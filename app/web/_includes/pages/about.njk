            Thanks for asking. Well, this project arose from a personal need
            to stay up to date with what's happening in my country üáøüá≤. I'm
            generally terrible at keeping up with current affairs, so I
            figured I'd put my programming skills to good use and take
            advantage of the recent AI developments to build a tool that
            would help me stay informed. This is the result. I hope you find
            it useful too.

            mentioned in each podcast episode).

          <p class="lead text-white">
            Each news item is then summarized using a

            algorithm, and a python script compiles everything into some
            kind of transcript for the podcast episode.
          </p>
          <p class="lead text-white">
            The transcript is then converted into an audio file using

          <p class="lead text-white">
            Next, some basic audio mixing is done to add an opening and
            closing jingle. Podcast metadata is then added to the audio
            file. At this point, the episode is ready to be published.

            All of the above processes are handled automatically, without

              </span>
              The same news item can be on multiple news platforms.
              Because each news item is summarized independently, the same
              news item can be repeated in the same episode, though using
              different words. This is still a work in progress.
              Hopefully, I'll figure out a way to detect duplicates and
              consolidate them into a single news item.

              No opinions are expressed in the podcast. The news items are
              presented as they are, without any commentary.

              The text to speech technology is not perfect. Sometimes, the
              pronunciation of certain words (especially Zambian words,
              names, places, etc.) is not correct. After some experiment,
              I found that, of all the English voices available, the one
              with better pronunciation is

              Because the news items are presented as summaries, the
              podcast episodes are usually short, between 8 and 16 minutes
              long, depending on the number of news items on that day.

              Links to the original news articles are included in the show
              notes, so you can read the full articles if you want to know

              This whole thing is an experiment in automation and
              artificial intelligence. The best way to learn a craft is by
              building things, and that's what I'm doing here. I'm
              learning as I go, and I'm having a lot of fun doing it. I
              hope you enjoy listening to the podcast as much as I enjoy
              tinkering with the technology behind it.
