Our nation today witnesses the restoration of a cherished landmark, grapples with safeguarding the integrity of education, navigates economic realities impacting citizens' pockets, and observes ongoing political discourse shaping our democratic journey.

## Main Stories
1.  **Historic Pamodzi Hotel Reopens as Symbol of National Pride**
    The iconic Pamodzi Hotel on Lusaka's Church Road, a cornerstone of Zambian diplomacy and national celebrations since 1979, is being revitalized, ready to once again host dignitaries and serve as a venue for significant moments in the lives of ordinary Zambians.
2.  **ECZ Nullifies Results, Suspends Five GCE Exam Centres for Irregularities**
    The Examinations Council of Zambia has nullified results for 1,654 candidates and suspended five GCE examination centres in North-Western, Luapula, Muchinga, and Lusaka provinces for two years due to irregularities detected during the 2025 exams, underscoring the critical importance of upholding educational standards for our youth.
3.  **Kwacha Appreciation Yet to Translate into Lower Vehicle Prices, Dealers Say**
    The Zambia Motor Dealers Association states that the recent appreciation of the Kwacha, now stabilising around K22 to the US dollar, has not yet led to lower vehicle prices for consumers, as the benefits take time to filter through due to the lengthy process of ordering stock from overseas.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Governance & Justice:** MP Francis Kapyanga (Mpika - PF) admitted his description of UPND members as "hooligans" was unparliamentary following a seven-day suspension from the National Assembly.
* **Local Development:** Livingstone UPND MP Rodney Sikumba highlighted that over K15 million in Constituency Development Fund (CDF) grants and loans had been allocated to Livingstone Constituency in 2025, asserting the UPND government's development efforts.
* **Electoral Process:** ECZ Chief Electoral Officer Brown Kasaro urged stakeholders to rely solely on official Commission updates regarding voter registration figures, following contradictory claims about Southern Province numbers.
* **Political Commentary:** PF MPs Brian Mundubile (Mporokoso) and George Chisanga (Lukashya) criticised President Hichilema's recent address and approach to constitutional amendments (Bill 7), suggesting he treats the constitution personally.
* **Political Commentary:** Governance activist Rueben Lifuka Lifuka advised the UPND government to focus on its performance record for the 2026 elections rather than lamenting the past, stating citizens will judge on delivery.

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
* Monitor the reopening timeline and impact of the revitalised Pamodzi Hotel on Lusaka's hospitality sector and national image.
*.
* Observe how the Kwacha's stability between K22-K24 affects import prices, including essential goods and vehicles, in the coming months.
* Await the ECZ's final, official report on the national voter registration exercise and the next steps following the GCE centre suspensions.
