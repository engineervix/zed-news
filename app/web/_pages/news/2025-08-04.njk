## Zambia Daily Brief: Monday, August 4th, 2025

**Overview:** Today's news cycle is dominated by intensifying political jockeying for the 2026 general elections, alongside significant developments impacting citizens' economic prospects and public health. Opposition unity talks, leadership challenges, and ruling party confidence dominate the political landscape, while a concerning drop in breastfeeding rates and cautious economic advice highlight pressing social and economic challenges. Governance issues, including a high-profile burial dispute and conditional offers to former officials, add further complexity.

### Key Stories (Ordered by Impact)

1.  **[Breastfeeding Rates Decline Poses Health Risk]**
    **A significant 6% drop in national breastfeeding rates threatens infant health and nutrition.** Falling from 70% (2018) to 64% (2024), this decline is attributed to weakening support systems for mothers, undermining critical early childhood development despite still exceeding WHO targets. Urgent interventions are needed to reverse this dangerous trend impacting Zambia's future generations.

2.  **[Opposition Unity Push Gains Momentum for 2026]**
    **Major opposition figures are coalescing around the critical need for a single presidential candidate to challenge President Hichilema in 2026.** UNITED Kwacha Alliance leader Sakwiba Sikota emphasized that voters will reject fragmented opposition parties, signalling a potential major shift in the political landscape as leaders recognize unity as the only viable path to victory.

3.  **[Lungu Family Fights State Burial in South African Court]**
    **The legal battle over former President Edgar Lungu's burial location has escalated, raising profound questions about state obligations and legacy.** The family's request to dismiss the Zambian government's bid, citing past mistreatment, directly challenges the state's authority under the Benefits Act and could set a contentious precedent for the treatment of former leaders.

4.  **[Citizens Urged: Cautious Optimism Amid Economic Signals]**
    **Economist Andrew Chibuye advises Zambians to adopt cautious optimism and seize opportunities within the country's improving economic outlook.** While acknowledging persistent challenges like global risks, he stresses that citizen initiative and fiscal discipline alongside government prudence (e.g., falling commodity prices, infrastructure projects) are key to unlocking tangible benefits from the positive trajectory.

5.  **[UPND Dismisses PF as "No Match" Amid Mfuwe Tensions]**
    **UPND National Chairman Collins Maoma declared the Patriotic Front (PF) "no match," deflecting vote-buying allegations ahead of the Mfuwe by-election.** This assertion underscores the ruling party's growing confidence but also intensifies political friction, potentially distracting from substantive policy discussions as elections approach.

6.  **[Kalaba Vows to Empower Zambians in Small-Scale Mining]**
    **Citizens First leader Harry Kalaba launched his presidential bid with a populist pledge to restrict foreign involvement and prioritize Zambians in small-scale mining licenses.** Promising to replicate Ghana's revenue success, this economic nationalist stance directly targets voters feeling excluded from resource benefits, posing a potential challenge to the incumbent's economic approach.

7.  **[VP Nalumango Appeals for Unity Ahead of 2026 Elections]**
    **Vice President Mutale Nalumango called on church leaders and citizens to foster unity and peace, countering tribalism and hate speech ahead of the 2026 polls.** This appeal highlights the government's concern about rising divisive rhetoric and underscores the critical need for social cohesion during the charged electoral period.

8.  **[ZESCO Wins Top Awards for Climate-Resilient Energy Drive]**
    **ZESCO's double win at the Agricultural Commercial Show (Best Exhibit, Infrastructure Development) spotlights its push towards a climate-resilient energy system.** Recognition alongside ERB and Stanbic Bank signifies progress and collaboration in Zambia's crucial energy transition, impacting long-term economic stability and sustainability.

### Other Notable Stories
* **PF-UPND Tensions:** UPND Deputy Spokesperson Elvis Nkandu questioned Nkana MP Binwell Mpundu's presidential viability due to behaviour and national profile.
* **Governance & Accountability:** The Centre for Anti-Corruption Advocacy (CAAC) warned against using anti-corruption efforts as a "government fundraising venture." The government conditionally invited Prof. Clive Chirwa to contribute, demanding he first "exonerate himself" regarding past PF ties.
* **Honoring Service:** President Hichilema honored the late Ackson Sejani (former Minister, LGSC Chair) with an official funeral and national mourning day.
* **Regional Cooperation:** Presidents Hichilema and Botswana's Mokgweetsi Masisi agreed on time-bound roadmaps to implement bilateral agreements effectively.

### Key Takeaways & Watch This Week
1.  **2026 Election Dynamics Intensify:** The push for opposition unity is now central, while ruling party confidence and new challengers like Kalaba reshape the field. Watch for concrete alliance formations or further fragmentation.
2.  **Economic Caution Meets Opportunity:** While signs of improvement exist (Chibuye), translating this into widespread citizen benefit requires proactive effort and discipline. Monitor policy shifts, especially regarding resource nationalism (mining).
3.  **Health & Governance Challenges Persist:** The breastfeeding decline demands immediate policy attention. The Lungu burial case outcome will have lasting implications for state protocols and national reconciliation. Anti-corruption rhetoric faces credibility tests.
