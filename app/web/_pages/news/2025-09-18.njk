Today's developments highlight our nation's ongoing efforts to strengthen healthcare access and public safety, while persistent energy challenges and political discourse continue to shape daily life and national unity.

## Main Stories
1.  **ZESCO Increases Residential Power Supply Amid Load Shedding Concerns**  
    ZESCO has increased power supply for residential customers to six hours daily, apologising for schedule fluctuations while reaffirming its commitment to customer communication. This adjustment addresses widespread citizen frustration over energy access impacting daily routines and business planning.
2.  **Fake Doctor Arrested for Defrauding Lusaka Woman**  
    Lusaka Police have detained Malawian national Michael Phiri, 39, for obtaining K20,000 by false pretences from Susan Nambeya, 42, after he falsely claimed to be a doctor who could secure her son's operation at UTH through Social Welfare. This arrest underscores the critical need for public vigilance against scams targeting vulnerable citizens seeking essential services.
3.  **Govt Delivers 119 Ambulances as Part of Healthcare Devolution**  
    President Hakainde Hichilema announced the delivery of 119 ambulances, highlighting the government's focus on improving decentralised primary healthcare services at the local level as part of broader efforts to enhance health access across our communities.
4.  **Mambilima MP Discourages Youth from "Hostile" Politics After Alleged Attack**  
    PF Mambilima MP Jean Chisenga reported being attacked by a suspected UPND member during the National Assembly opening, leading her to actively discourage youth from entering politics due to the current hostile environment, raising concerns about political tolerance and safety.
5.  **Mpika MP Kapyanga Suspended for 14 Days Over Speaker Comments**  
    Speaker Nelly Mutti suspended Mpika MP Francis Kapyanga for 14 days without pay or allowances for contempt, following disrespectful remarks about her office published in a newspaper, reinforcing the importance of parliamentary decorum and respect for institutions.
6.  **Health Minister Confirms Recruitment Plans for 200 Volunteer Medical Officers**  
    Health Minister Dr. Elijah Muchima stated that approximately 200 volunteering medical officers not hired in the last recruitment drive will be employed this year, clarifying that while volunteering is valued, it is not a prerequisite for government recruitment into the health sector.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Governance & Justice:**  
    *   Police charged Ethel Chisomo Edwards, 42, based in the USA, with seditious practices and hate speech upon her arrival in Zambia, related to derogatory videos targeting President Hichilema, his family, photographer Chella Tukuta, Judith Kabemba, and the Zambian people.
    *   Zambia Must Prosper leader Kelvin Fube Bwalya criticised PF acting president Given Lubinda and Secretary General Raphael Nakacinda for failed leadership, attributing former president Edgar Lungu's return to their mismanagement of the party.
* **Sports Development:**  
    *   The government pledged full financial support (flights, accommodation, fees, nutrition) for 12 Zambian athletes, 3 coaches, and 4 officials to compete at the IMMAF World Championships in Tbilisi, Georgia, citing President Hichilema's personal interest in martial arts.
    *   FAZ General Secretary Machacha Shepande defended the U-17 team's early COSAFA exit, calling it a vital learning experience for future development, despite a 5-1 win over Madagascar in their final group game.
