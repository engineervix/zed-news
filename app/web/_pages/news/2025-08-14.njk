Corporate social responsibility initiatives are revitalizing education infrastructure on the Copperbelt, while significant climate adaptation funding is being deployed nationally. Security operations resulted in fatal encounters with armed suspects in Lusaka, and Zambia’s national football team faces a decisive continental championship match.

## Main Stories
1. **Chinese CSR Transforming Copperbelt Schools**  
   NFCA Mining funded a 1×4 classroom block for Namboard Community School in Chambishi, which previously operated from a makeshift Zambia Railways storeroom. Enrollment at the school increased from 448 pupils to over 500 after the construction, with 13-year-old Twiza Mwalilino noting improved conditions including desks replacing dusty floors.

2. **US$688 Million for Zambia’s Climate Adaptation**  
   Agriculture Minister Mtolo Phiri confirmed Zambia received US$688 million from the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program (AAAP) for climate resilience projects. The continental AAAP initiative is investing US$18 billion across Africa, targeting job creation and benefiting 79 million people.

3. **Four Killed in Chongwe Road Accident**  
   A collision between a Volvo truck and a Toyota Vitz near Petroda Filling Station in Silverest claimed four lives, including Chongwe District Hospital laboratory technician Mutapa Winston and driver Brian Mwense. Police reported the truck failed to keep to its lane and collided head-on with the Vitz, coming to rest atop the smaller vehicle.

4. **Two Suspects Fatally Shot in Garden House Operation**  
   Police shot dead two armed robbery suspects during an intelligence-led operation targeting ex-convict Nelson Chirwa in Garden House Compound on August 11. A 9mm Star pistol was recovered, and forensic analysis linked the deceased to the January 9 murder of businessman Sydney Mateyo and multiple robberies.
