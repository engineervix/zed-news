## Main Stories

1. Lungu’s Burial Controversy Sparks Political and Public Debate
The government, led by President Hichilema, faces criticism over the handling of former President Edgar Lungu’s funeral. Infrastructure Minister Charles Milupi emphasized that Lungu’s grave at Embassy Park remains available, despite the family’s decision to bury him in South Africa. NGOs like NGOCC have expressed disappointment, raising questions about respecting former leaders and national traditions. This situation underscores the sensitivities involved in political transitions and the importance of balancing respect and public expectations during such moments.

2. Politicization of Empowerment Funds in Lumezi By-Elections
Small and Medium Enterprise Minister Elias Mubanga caused controversy by linking access to empowerment funds with voters' support for the ruling UPND in the upcoming Lumezi by-election. His remarks have sparked concerns over voter coercion and resource politicization, casting a shadow over the electoral process. The statement highlights the high stakes for voters amid promises of free education and socio-economic development.

3. Geopolitical Tensions and Fuel Prices
Despite escalating conflicts between Iran, the US, and Israel, Oil Marketing Companies Association of Zambia assures that fuel prices will remain stable. The appreciation of the Zambian Kwacha against major currencies is expected to buffer potential global oil price increases. This analysis suggests Zambia’s economy is resilient to external shocks, but vigilance remains necessary.

4. New Sports Complex in Livingstone: A Catalyst for Growth
The L/STONE sports complex, described as a game-changer by Minister Kangwa, is set to transform Livingstone’s economy. The modern infrastructure aims to attract international events, boost tourism, create jobs, and develop local talent. This strategic investment aligns with broader efforts to use sports as a driver for economic and social development.

5. Government Urges Market Stabilization Amid Rising Food Prices
As the Kwacha gains strength, the government has called on market players to reduce food prices, seeking to ease inflationary pressures on ordinary citizens. The move underscores efforts to stabilize the economy and ensure affordability for consumers.

6. Law Enforcement Collaboration to Fight Crime
The Drug Enforcement Commission (DEC) and the Road Transport and Safety Agency (RTSA) signed an MOU to share real-time vehicle data. This partnership aims to enhance investigations, improve law enforcement capabilities, and address rising crime rates, especially in transportation-related offenses.

7. Corruption in Education: Theft of GCE Funds Uncovered
A former head teacher revealed a scandal involving the theft of K717,600 meant for GCE registration, which resulted in only two students being registered. This case highlights ongoing issues of corruption in public institutions and the urgent need for transparency in managing educational funds.

8. Civil Society Launches Campaign Against Bill 7
The Oasis Forum’s coalition against Constitutional Amendment Bill 7 mobilizes citizens nationwide, protesting what they see as a lack of transparency and public participation. The campaign emphasizes the importance of a people-driven constitutional reform process, advocating for democratic integrity and citizen sovereignty.

9. Senseli Mine Closure and Safety Concerns
The government announced that Senseli Mine remains closed following a tragic incident that claimed 36 lives. Calls to reopen the mine have met resistance, with critics warning that reopening without proper safety measures risks further loss of life, especially given the ongoing economic implications for Chingola’s vulnerable communities.

10. President Hichilema Honors Former President Lungu’s Legacy
