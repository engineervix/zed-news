Today's news highlights Zambia's drive toward economic mobility and revenue generation, alongside significant developments in regional cooperation and national representation on global stages. Key themes include transport reforms for inclusive growth, strategic financial planning, and our athletes' pursuit of international glory.

## Main Stories
1.  **National Push to Legalize 2- and 3-Wheelers for Inclusive Transport**
    President Hakainde Hichilema's emphasis on inclusive growth spotlights transport challenges, where motorcycles and tricycles are vital, affordable solutions for rural and peri-urban mobility in provinces like Eastern and Luapula, easing access to clinics, markets, and schools for thousands. Legalizing and regulating these vehicles nationwide, following regional examples, promises to formalize livelihoods, expand the tax base, and enhance safety while reducing urban congestion and rural isolation.
2.  **ZRA Projects K239.8 Billion Contribution to National Budget by 2028**
    The Zambia Revenue Authority projects its contribution to the national budget will reach K239.8 billion by 2028, underscoring the critical role of Domestic Resource Mobilization for funding Zambia's development as global aid declines. ZRA Corporate Communications Manager Oliver Nzala emphasized the media's partnership in combating corruption, citing the recent arrest of a Chinese national attempting to bribe an officer with K10,000.
3.  **Zambia, Botswana Set to Launch Kazungula Bridge Authority on October 15**
    Zambia and Botswana are preparing to commission the Kazungula Bridge Authority (KBA) on October 15, 2025, dissolving previous joint committees to establish a new Council of Ministers, KBA Board, and management structure. Progress on finalizing the Host Agreement, to be signed at the launch, marks a significant step in formalizing the management of this key regional trade and transit corridor.
4.  **Under-20 Women's Team Faces Burundi in Crucial World Cup Qualifier**
    Our Zambia Under-20 Women’s National Team aims to advance towards the 2026 FIFA U20 Women’s World Cup in a crucial qualifier against Burundi today in Bujumbura, with the return leg in Ndola on September 27. Coach Charity Nthala's strong 21-member squad, captained by Blessings Zangose Zulu, carries the hopes of making history for Zambia in this tournament.
5.  **Immigration Apprehends Over 500 Foreign Illegal Gold Miners Since February**
    The Department of Immigration has intensified operations against illegal gold mining, apprehending over 500 foreign nationals nationwide since February, including 368 arrests in Mufumbwe, North-Western Province, between June and August. This crackdown by the Ministry of Home Affairs and Internal Security aims to curb non-Zambian involvement in this illicit activity and protect our national resources.
