Today’s news digest highlights Zambia’s ongoing political, economic, and social developments, with a focus on government efforts to boost national productivity, the impact of global debt issues on Africa, and notable achievements in sports and justice. The themes of governance, economic resilience, and societal challenges are prominent, reflecting a nation navigating complex internal and external pressures.

## Main Stories

1. **AFRODAD Raises Alarm Over Africa’s Mounting Debt Crisis**  
Africa’s debt burden has surged to $1.8 trillion in 2023, with countries paying $163 million in interest alone in 2024. The continent faces a critical challenge due to high borrowing costs and a global financial system that perpetuates inequality and dependency. This debt crisis threatens Africa’s economic sovereignty and sustainable growth, calling for urgent reforms to create a fairer, more inclusive financial architecture. Zambia, like many nations, is impacted by these issues, which could influence future development strategies.

2. **Zambia’s Fight Against Financial Crime Gets a Boost**  
Zambia’s Drug Enforcement Commission (DEC) is stepping up efforts to combat white-collar crimes such as money laundering and cyber fraud, emphasizing the need for law enforcement to adopt advanced skills and technology. DEC Director General Nason Banda highlighted that traditional methods are insufficient against sophisticated financial threats, signaling a push for innovation in enforcement. This reflects a broader global trend of increasing cybercrime and the importance of strengthening legal and technological capacity to protect economic integrity.

3. **Political Climate Tense as Prof. Nkandu Luo’s Police Summons Sparks Debate**  
Professor Nkandu Luo’s recent summons by police over comments about former President Edgar Lungu’s son reveal rising tensions around free speech and political expression in Zambia. Critics argue that such actions may stifle open debate and criticise perceived censorship. The incident underscores ongoing concerns about the balance between accountability and political suppression in Zambia’s evolving democracy.

4. **Football and Community: Chief Mpezeni Praises Fashion Sakala’s Contributions**  
Chief Mpezeni publicly commended football star Fashion Sakala for his philanthropic work in Eastern Province, expressing confusion over his exclusion from the national team, Chipolopolo. The chief’s remarks highlight the tension between off-field community service and on-field opportunities, raising questions about the criteria used for national team selection and the recognition of players’ broader societal impact.

5. **Government Calls for Rejection of Bill 7, Urges Civil Society Leadership**  
Mundubile, a government spokesperson, urged that Bill 7 be abandoned in favor of allowing civil society and church leaders to steer the reform process. This stance reflects ongoing debates about legislative reforms and the role of civil society in shaping national policies, emphasizing a preference for inclusive, community-led approaches rather than top-down parliamentary changes.

6. **President Hakainde Hichilema’s Dedication Underlines Focus on Results**  
State House responded to claims about presidential holidays by emphasizing President Hichilema’s relentless work ethic, asserting he is committed to addressing Zambia’s economic challenges. The recent commissioning of the 100 MW Chisamba Solar Plant demonstrates the government’s focus on sustainable energy and economic growth, emphasizing practical governance aimed at tangible development outcomes.

7. **Zambian Boxing Achieves Historic Win with Mwale’s WBC Title**  
David Mwale’s victory in securing the WBC International Bantamweight title marks Zambia’s first such achievement in 35 years. The win has energized national pride and spotlighted Zambia’s potential in sports, with the government and sports authorities celebrating this milestone as a sign of emerging athletic talent and international recognition.

8. **Progress in Public Service Reform and Inclusivity**  
Mweetwa highlighted Zambia’s strides in strengthening public institutions through decentralization, aiming to address historical inequalities. Protecting experienced public servants is seen as vital to maintaining institutional integrity and service quality, signaling ongoing efforts to build an inclusive and resilient public sector.

9. **Kaunda’s Son Urges Lungu’s Family Toward Unity in Burial Arrangements**  
The son of Zambia’s first president, Kenneth Kaunda, called on the family of former President Edgar Lungu to set aside political differences and facilitate the return of Lungu’s body to Zambia. The appeal underscores the importance of national unity and respect for former leaders, emphasizing that post-presidency legacy should be viewed beyond partisan divides.

10. **President Hichilema Stresses Practical Governance at State House**  
Hichilema dismissed notions of luxury at State House, describing it as a place for work and service. His administration’s focus on renewable energy projects, like the Chisamba Solar Plant, highlights a strategic approach to economic diversification and environmental sustainability, positioning Zambia as a leader in green energy and economic resilience.

11. **Kelvin Sampa’s Corruption Conviction Reinforces Justice Efforts**  
The conviction of Kelvin Sampa, a former Kasama Member of Parliament, to two years in prison for fraud demonstrates Zambia’s commitment to fighting corruption. This case serves as a warning to public officials about the consequences of abuse of office and corruption, reinforcing efforts to promote transparency and accountability.

12. **Fuel Price Reduction Promises Economic Relief**  
The UPND government announced a cut in fuel prices, which is expected to lower transportation costs and overall living expenses.
