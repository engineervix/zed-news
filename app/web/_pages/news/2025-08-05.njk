### Zambia Daily News Digest  
**Tuesday, 5 August 2025**  

**Overview**  
Today’s news is dominated by **healthcare reforms** and **economic governance**, with significant developments in public health infrastructure and fiscal management. Concurrently, **political tensions** escalate ahead of the 2026 elections, marked by opposition critiques and a high-stakes legal battle over former President Lungu’s burial. Citizen welfare anchors these themes, from healthcare costs to unpaid worker benefits.  

---

### Key Stories (Ranked by Impact on Citizens)  
1. **[Govt Commissions CT Scanners, MRI to Boost Public Healthcare]**  
   **Critical diagnostic services expand nationwide** with seven new CT scanners and one MRI machine in public hospitals. This eliminates costly private referrals for 90% of Zambians reliant on public healthcare, directly reducing mortality from delayed diagnoses. Installation includes warranties, staff training, and solar backups.  

2. **[NHIMA Contributions to Increase Amid Healthcare Strain]**  
   **Citizens face higher monthly deductions** as the government raises NHIMA premiums to fund overstretched services. This comes despite cancer hospital delays (now expected December 2025), placing immediate financial pressure on households while promising long-term service upgrades.  

3. **[30 General Workers Sue Govt Over K25m Unpaid Benefits]**  
   **Systemic worker rights failures surface** as 30 laborers sue for terminal benefits after constructing the Government Complex. The K25m claim exposes accountability gaps in public projects, risking erosion of trust in state employment.  

4. **[Energy Access Jumps to 54%, Focus on Renewables]**  
   **20% more Zambians gained electricity since 2021**, accelerating economic mobility and reducing reliance on hazardous fuels. Renewable investments signal lower long-term costs, though rural coverage gaps persist.  

5. **[Pretoria Court to Rule on Lungu Burial, Straining Unity]**  
   **A judicial decision on ex-President Lungu’s burial site** (Zambia vs. South Africa) risks deepening political fractures. The government’s pledge to respect the ruling is tested amid family claims of "persecution," impacting social cohesion.  

6. **[Govt Deficit Cut to 3.1% Amid Fiscal Discipline]**  
   **Debt sustainability efforts benefit ordinary Zambians** as controlled spending eases inflation risks. Expert Andrew Chibuye credits expenditure restraint but warns social programs must not be undermined.  

7. **[Chinese Investment Scrutiny Urged for "National Interest"]**  
   **Activist Rueben Lifuka demands transparent Sino-Zambian deals**, criticizing lopsided contracts. With China holding $6.4bn of Zambia’s debt, renegotiations could free up funds for public services.  

8. **[Opposition Viability Debated Amid 2026 Election Tensions]**  
   **UPND’s dismissal of opposition relevance sparks backlash**, with NCP positioning as an alternative. Citizen choice narrows as rhetoric escalates, potentially polarizing the Mfuwe by-election (date unannounced).

### Other Notable Stories  
**Political Dynamics**  
* PF accuses UPND of "clinging to power at all costs" (Item 4).  
* NCP leader Chanda eyes 2026 elections, condemning UPND "vote-buying" (Item 5).  
* President Hichilema eulogizes late minister Sejani as "democracy defender" (Item 11).  
* MP Kang’ombe praises HH’s "humble wealth" as model leadership (Item 9).  

**Accountability & Society**  
* Ex-Prime TV presenter arrested for alleged client fund theft (Item 12).  
* Lungu family seeks divine intervention over burial stalemate (Item 15).  

**Sports**  
* Zambian Prisca Chilufya scores first goal for Orlando Pride (Item 6).

### Key Takeaways & Future Watch  
1. **Healthcare Crossroads**: NHIFA hikes and new diagnostics must translate to tangible service improvements by December 2025; monitor cancer hospital deadlines.  
2. **Economic Balancing Act**: Fiscal discipline (3.1% deficit) must protect social spending amid worker lawsuits and energy/renewable investments.  
3. **Political Stress Tests**: Resolution of the Lungu burial case (Pretoria ruling imminent) and Mfuwe by-election will gauge democratic stability.  

**Watch This Week**: NHIMA contribution formula details, Pretoria Court verdict on Lungu burial, and Q3 2025 fiscal performance data.
