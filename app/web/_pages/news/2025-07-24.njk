Today’s Zambian news digest reflects a nation at the crossroads of political integrity, economic empowerment, and social development. Key themes include political accountability and leadership, economic participation, sports development, and innovative infrastructure projects aimed at vulnerable populations. Several stories highlight ongoing concerns about governance, fairness in sports, and social issues, emphasizing the country's pursuit of stability, growth, and transparency.

## Main Stories

1. **HH is a celebrity admired by many – Muchima**
Health Minister Dr. Elijah Muchima praises President Hakainde Hichilema’s leadership, asserting that his celebrity status fosters admiration and confidence among Zambians. He links this popularity to the government’s efforts to address healthcare sector shortcomings, including outdated equipment and governance issues. The Minister is optimistic that under President Hichilema’s leadership, Zambia will witness transformative improvements over the next decade, signaling a focus on long-term reform and stability.

2. **It’s possible to do clean politics – Nalumango**
Vice-President Mutale Nalumango advocates for moral integrity in Zambian politics, emphasizing that corruption stems from the moral character of leaders rather than systemic flaws alone. She urges a cultural shift towards ethical governance, suggesting that Zambia’s development challenges are deeply rooted in leadership values. Her comments highlight the need for a moral renaissance in politics to foster national growth and trust.

3. **Those who sit, do nothing won’t get benefit of Kwacha gain – govt**
Chief Government Spokesperson Cornelius Mweetwa underscores the importance of active economic participation to benefit from Zambia’s appreciating currency.

4. **Viral audio controversy raises questions about political manipulation**
A leaked recording allegedly involving PF faction leader Robert Chabinga and Minister Doreen Mwamba suggests an attempt to influence judicial proceedings related to ex-President Edgar Lungu’s burial rights.

Calls are mounting for the President to clarify the situation as the scandal threatens public trust.

5. **Zambia's Chipolopolo focus on long-term talent development at CHAN**
Coach Avram Grant emphasizes using the 2025 African Nations Championship (CHAN) to nurture local talent and build depth for the national team. Zambia sees CHAN as a platform to develop homegrown players who could eventually move to European leagues, addressing the scarcity of Zambian players abroad and strengthening the national football pipeline. The strategic focus aims at sustainable growth rather than just immediate results.

6. **Financial disparity undermines fairness in Zambian football – IG Musamba**
Police IG Graphel Musamba laments the unfair financial advantages enjoyed by certain football clubs, which hinder fair competition and talent retention, particularly at Nkwazi FC.

8. **Kaluya Bwalya emphasizes discipline for Power Dynamos players**
Football legend Kalusha Bwalya offers advice to Power Dynamos, urging players to stay disciplined and focused to succeed. His mentorship highlights the role of lifestyle and self-care in athletic performance, reinforcing the importance of experienced role models in nurturing Zambia’s football talent.

9. **Mumbi Phiri disputes AI fabrication claim amid political controversy**
Former Patriotic Front official Mumbi Phiri challenges Robert Chabinga’s assertion that a damaging audio was AI-generated, suggesting it is part of a broader tactic to distract from a forensic audit on drug theft. The dispute exposes internal party struggles and questions over credibility, with implications for political accountability in Zambia.

10. **Law enforcement cracks down on misconduct among female officers**
