Zambia navigates cultural vibrancy, institutional integrity, and citizen safety today, with developments in education governance, road safety for children, judicial accountability, sports discipline, and recognition of evolving local artistry shaping our national conversation.

## Main Stories
1.  **Chingola Schools Directed to Confiscate Politically Labelled Books**
    District Education Board Secretary Noah Simulunga has ordered all school head teachers in Chingola to seize books distributed to pupils bearing political messages, stating this violates the Education Act and governance policies; he instructed that records be kept to replace these books with plain ones, ensuring our schools remain neutral learning environments.
2.  **Yango Zambia and ZRST Launch Safer Journeys to School in Lusaka**
    Yango Zambia and the Zambia Road Safety Trust have launched the Safer Journeys to School initiative, delivering road safety training to over 8,000 children and implementing infrastructure upgrades like zebra crossings and speed humps at five high-risk government schools in Lusaka, directly addressing the alarming statistic that over a quarter of Zambia's road fatalities involve children.
3.  **FIFA Fines FAZ $3,000 Over Crowd Trouble During Morocco Qualifier**
    The Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) has been fined by FIFA for failing to maintain order and security during the World Cup qualifier against Morocco at Levy Mwanawasa Stadium, where fans threw objects onto the pitch; this sanction highlights the need for improved spectator conduct as our national team prepares for upcoming crucial qualifiers against Tanzania and Niger.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Governance & Justice:**
    *   Judgment in the case against former High Court Judge Wilfred Muma, accused of abuse of authority related to the cancellation of a Zambia Army land title and its reallocation, is set for March 26, 2026, by the Economic and Financial Crimes Court, after it dismissed his application to refer constitutional questions to the Constitutional Court.
* **Culture & Arts:**
    *   The Born and Bred Music Awards have introduced two new video categories, Dunka and Best Traditional Video, alongside Best Female and Best Upcoming Female categories to enhance recognition; Awards Founder Innocent Kalaluka emphasized the focus is on quality videos nationwide, urging musicians to invest in their craft for the evolving industry â€“ perhaps our next big hit is simmering like a pot of nshima somewhere!

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
1.  The effectiveness of the Safer Journeys to School initiative in reducing child road accidents around the five upgraded Lusaka schools will be crucial for potential nationwide expansion.
2.  The outcome of the case against former Commissioner of Lands Wilfred Muma will set a significant precedent regarding accountability in the management of public property.
3.  Fan behaviour during the upcoming Zambia vs Niger World Cup qualifier at Levy Mwanawasa Stadium will be closely watched to avoid further FIFA sanctions and uphold our nation's sporting reputation.
