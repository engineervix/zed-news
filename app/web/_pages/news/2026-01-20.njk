Today's news highlights crucial developments in justice, national development, and social welfare, reflecting our collective commitment to progress and accountability. Significant court testimonies emerge in a high-profile murder case, transformative constituency delimitation promises equitable development, and Government responds decisively to farmers affected by natural disaster.

## Main Stories
1.  **Detailed Testimony in Miti Murder Trial**  
    Evidence presented in the Lusaka High Court revealed Meya Masumba, accused of killing her husband Dr. Francisco Miti, allegedly instructed her maid Esther Miti to hide a blood-stained pickaxe head on August 17, 2024, shortly after Dr. Miti suffered fatal injuries during a reported robbery at their Mount Makulu home. This development underscores the gravity of the case involving a former government secretary and two herbalists, impacting public confidence in justice for violent crime.
2.  **Constituency Delimitation to Accelerate National Development**  
    Zambia's ongoing constituency delimitation, supported by the enhanced K40 million Constituency Development Fund (CDF), aims to correct historical imbalances by dividing oversized constituencies like Kasama and Kanyama, ensuring resources for services like water, electricity, education, and healthcare reach all communities equitably. This restructuring, praised by MPs Anthony Mumba and Joseph Munsanje as fundamental for fairness and efficient service delivery, brings development closer to citizens nationwide.
3.  **Government Compensates Southern Province Flood Victims**  
    The Government will provide nearly 20 tonnes of maize seed and over 6,700 bags of fertiliser to farmers in Monze District's Bweengwa and Hamusankwe areas, compensating for damage to 846 hectares of crops caused by recent flash floods. Southern Province Minister Credo Nanjuwa confirmed this direct intervention to support affected agricultural livelihoods and aid recovery in the flood-ravaged region.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Crime & Justice:**  
    *   Eastern Province Police report Lameck Banda, 40, assaulted his wife and accidentally punched their two-week-old baby during a dispute over selling fertiliser for beer money in Chipata; the infant is hospitalised with head injuries at St Francis Mission Hospital.
    *   Chingola Police investigate an assault where landlord 'Chama Mayanda' and three others allegedly broke into tenant Arnold Mwape's Nchanga South house, kicking him in the groin causing injuries and stealing K25,500 cash and other items; Mwape is admitted to Nchanga North General Hospital.
* **Politics & Governance:**  
    *   New Congress Party leader Peter Chanda publicly warned FDD leader Chifumu Banda to be wary of potential takeover attempts by certain Patriotic Front figures within their alliance, citing his own party's experience and declaring NCP's independence from the opposition coalition.
    *   Eastern Province Police dispersed 250-300 people gathered without prior notification at PF presidential hopeful Makebi Zulu's Mambwe residence, citing security concerns; Police Commanding Officer Robertson Mweemba reiterated the legal requirement to notify authorities for public gatherings.
* **Economy & Security:**  
    *   Zambia Revenue Authority intercepted 800 cases of cigarettes smuggled from South Africa via Chirundu OSBP, falsely declared for DRC transit but bearing Zambian excise stamps, preventing a K10 million tax loss and highlighting ongoing efforts to combat customs fraud.
    *   Kitwe businesswoman Khadija Mingel, 36, must answer charges of trafficking 500 grams of cocaine after a court found a prima facie case; DEC officers testified recovering 25 pellets of the drug from her vehicle at a Kitwe supermarket on May 14, 2025.
* **Governance & Justice:**  
    *   Police opened a docket against Matero MP Miles Sampa under the Cyber Crimes Act following a complaint by the Electoral Commission of Zambia (ECZ) regarding his January 15 allegations about an illegal polling station in Chawama, despite his subsequent apology.

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
* Monitor the implementation of flood relief for Southern Province farmers to ensure timely delivery of seeds and fertiliser for the next planting season.
* Observe the progression of the Miti murder trial and the case against MP Miles Sampa, as both have significant implications for judicial integrity and public trust in institutions.
* Track the ZRA's enforcement actions against smuggling following the major cigarette seizure, crucial for safeguarding national revenue.
