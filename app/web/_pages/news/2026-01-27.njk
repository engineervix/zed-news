Our nation today witnesses a renewed sense of economic optimism as debt restructuring progresses, fostering investor confidence and projections of robust growth exceeding 6.4%. Simultaneously, Zambia strengthens its global partnerships through diplomatic engagements, while homegrown artistic talent achieves international fusion.

## Main Stories
1.  **Economy Poised for Stronger Growth Than Projected**
    President Hichilema announced Zambia is set to surpass its projected 6.4% GDP growth for this year, crediting significant progress in debt restructuring and economic stability achieved through the UPND administration's reforms, which have drawn praise from international capital market players like J.P. Morgan.
2.  **Zambia Deepens Diplomatic Ties with Key Nations**
    President Hichilema received credentials from new ambassadors and high commissioners from Germany, Japan, Ghana, Namibia, and Colombia, emphasizing Zambia's commitment to deepening historical relationships for mutual benefit, particularly focusing on peace, security, economic development, and trade to serve our citizens.
3.  **Zambian-Dutch Artist Creates Genre-Blending Musical "Détente"**
    Dutch-Zambian artist dESH.DUBS (Desh Chisukulu) and Belgian artist Ave Lynn have released "Détente," a unique track born from a chance meeting in Lusaka that seamlessly blends rugged Reggae, elegant Neo-Soul, and vibrant Afrobeat, showcasing creative synergy and exploring themes of peace after conflict, elevating Zambia's cultural presence.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Governance & Investment:**
    *   President Hichilema assured a delegation of global investors led by J.P. Morgan's Gbolahan Taiwo that Zambia remains committed to a stable, predictable, and competitive investment environment, promoting joint ventures and PPPs, leveraging the successful 36-month debt restructuring to attract capital into key sectors like energy, mining, and agriculture.
* **Public Safety:**
    *   Bus driver Brian Banda, 44, died in a collision on the Lusaka-Kafue Road near Apex Filling Station after a Dongfeng truck (driver Joseph Mwenda, 34) failed to give way; the 16 passengers escaped unhurt, but the truck driver fled before later surrendering to Chilanga Police.
    *   Two-year-old Loveness Gwanda drowned in her Kuku Compound home in Lusaka after heavy rains flooded the sitting room where she was sleeping; her mother discovered the tragedy around 02:00 hours on January 26, 2026.
* **Justice:**
    *   Security guards Obert Mandevu, 35, and Mildred Nkandu, 29, were fined K1,500 each (or 5 months imprisonment) by the Lusaka Magistrate’s Court after admitting to stealing K3,730 worth of Brutal Fruit, Castle Lite, Flying Fish, and Black Label beer from Zambian Breweries, where they were employed to protect the property.
* **Police Reports:**
    *   A 62-year-old medical doctor from Luanshya collapsed and died during an encounter at a Mpongwe District guest house on January 24, 2026; his companion, a 50-year-old woman, has been detained by Masaiti Police to assist investigations after initially attempting to flee.
