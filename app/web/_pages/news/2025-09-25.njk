Today's developments highlight our nation's economic resilience through agricultural exports and energy innovation, while also addressing critical challenges in SME empowerment and public service delivery. Unity and accountability remain central themes as we navigate both domestic priorities and international partnerships.

## Main Stories
1.  **Low SME Loan Repayment Threatens Empowerment Program**  
    Minister Elias Mubanga revealed only 10,000 out of 46,000 SMEs benefiting from Citizens Economic Empowerment Commission (CEEC) loans are repaying them. This low repayment rate jeopardizes a vital initiative designed to uplift marginalized Zambians and drive broad-based economic growth.
2.  **Zambia Becomes Regional Fertilizer Exporter**  
    Commerce Minister Chipoka Mulenga announced Zambia is now exporting fertilizer to all eight neighbouring countries, including Burundi. This achievement, highlighted during a tour of the United Capital Fertilizer plant, positions our nation among Africa's leading fertilizer manufacturers and boosts our trade profile.
3.  **ZESCO Secures K66.5m for Chadiza Solar & Storage Project**  
    ZESCO Limited and Indo Zambia Bank finalized K66.5 million in green financing for a 2.5MW solar power plant with integrated battery storage in Chadiza. This project aims to provide clean, stable electricity to underserved areas and diversify our national energy mix for greater grid reliability.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Governance & Justice:** Former Lumezi MP Munir Zulu has sued the State in the Lusaka High Court, alleging correctional officers stripped him naked and searched his private parts in front of other inmates, violating his constitutional rights.
* **Energy:** Speaker of the National Assembly Nelly Mutti clarified that despite emergency tariffs, citizens only pay for the electricity they actually consume, following concerns raised in parliament about tariffs and power supply.
* **Agriculture:** The Food Reserve Agency (FRA) intends to complete payments to all maize-supplying farmers by October 31, 2025. Board Chairperson Suresh Desai attributed delays to purchasing 1.7 million metric tonnes, significantly above the budgeted 500,000 metric tonnes.
* **Politics:** The "Zambia We Want" party will hold a presidential re-run next week between Kapembwa Simbao and Ernest Mwape after neither secured 50% +1 of the vote at their convention, as confirmed by Secretary General Muhabi Lungu.
* **Diplomacy:** Former cabinet secretary Leslie Mbula interpreted President Hakainde Hichilema's comments on ambassadors as a warning to underperforming envoys that they risk recall, emphasizing expectations for their roles.
* **National Unity:** President Hakain Hichilema affirmed that no single ethnic group in Zambia is superior to another, stating all 73 tribes own the country equally during a meeting with traditional leaders at Mulungushi International Conference Centre.
* **Business/Global Partnerships:** Betting company 1xBet has extended its global partnership with Paris Saint-Germain football club for three more seasons, retaining its status as the club's Official Betting Partner.

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
* Monitor the implementation of reforms to the CEEC's SME loan program to improve repayment rates and ensure its long-term viability for citizen empowerment.
* Track the rollout of the Chadiza solar project as a potential model for deploying integrated renewable energy and storage solutions to other underserved regions.
* Observe the FRA's progress in meeting the October 31st deadline for farmer payments, crucial for enabling timely preparation for the next farming season.
