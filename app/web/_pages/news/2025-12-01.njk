Zambia faces critical developments today touching our economic stability, governance processes, and public health priorities. Rising living costs in Lusaka demand household budget adjustments, while constitutional reforms and political realignments continue to shape our national dialogue. Concurrently, international commitments on tobacco control and local content in mining signal important shifts for our nation's future.

## Main Stories
1.  **Lusaka Cost of Living Rises Significantly**
    The Jesuit Centre for Theological Reflection reports the monthly cost of living for a family of five in Lusaka increased by K244.33, reaching K11,079.13 in November, driven primarily by higher prices for essential non-food items like charcoal, impacting household budgets across the capital.
2.  **Chawama Parliamentary Seat Declared Vacant, Challenged as Illegal**
    Following the continued absence of MP Tasila Lungu, Speaker Nelly Mutti declared the Chawama parliamentary seat vacant; PF presidential aspirant Makebi Zulu has labelled this decision illegal and an attack on democracy, stating he is prepared to legally challenge the move if instructed.
3.  **Urgent Call for Stronger Tobacco Control Post-COP11**
    Analysis argues Zambia must urgently remove the 75% excise tax exemption for local cigarettes and pass the Tobacco Products Control Bill, highlighting that tobacco kills over 7,000 Zambians annually and costs the economy ZMW 2.8 billion, with COP11 outcomes stressing the need to tackle industry interference and environmental harm from tobacco waste.
4.  **Kansanshi Mine Establishes Taskforce for Local Content Rules**
    Kansanshi Mine is forming a cross-functional taskforce to review contracts and identify opportunities for local suppliers, directly responding to the new Mining Local Content SI requiring mines to allocate at least 20% of their annual procurement budget to Zambian businesses.
5.  **Government Suspends Constitutional Talks with Oasis Forum**
    Chief Government Spokesperson Cornelius Mweetwa announced the suspension of dialogue with the Oasis Forum on constitutional reforms, stating the Forum arrived with a fixed position against the current process rather than engaging constructively, following their lengthy meeting with President Hichilema.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Governance & Justice:**
    *   Constitutional lawyer John Sangwa asserts that Constitutional Amendment Bill No. 7 of 2025 "does not exist" until the Technical Committee completes its work, questioning the timing of amendments close to an election.
* **Politics:**
    *   Former Religious Affairs Minister Rev. Godfridah Sumaili publicly endorsed Makebi Zulu for the PF presidency during a church service in Kabwe, where Zulu also donated 100 bags of cement.
    *   Home Affairs Minister Jack Mwiimbu stated citizens believe only the UPND can move Zambia forward, defending the Independent Broadcasting Authority Bill against PF concerns about potential abuse.
    *   Kelvin Fube Bwalya (KBF) offered his Zambia Must Prosper party as a "special purpose vehicle" for the Tonse Alliance, suggesting the PF is "politically knocked out".
* **National Dialogue:**
    *   Former Cabinet Secretary Leslie Mbula praised President Hichilema's press conference emphasis on dialogue, urging citizens to utilize this avenue over street demonstrations to address concerns.

1.  Monitor the implementation of the Mining Local Content SI and its initial impact on Zambian businesses supplying the sector, starting with Kansanshi's contract review.
