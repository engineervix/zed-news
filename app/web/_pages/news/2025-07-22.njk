Today’s news landscape in Zambia reflects a mix of political tensions, economic developments, and social progress. Key themes include ongoing political volatility and factional disputes, efforts to improve education and transparency, and signs of Zambia’s youth talent gaining international recognition. Economic indicators reveal both progress and challenges, with revenue shortfalls and significant dividends from state enterprises. These stories collectively showcase a nation navigating complex internal dynamics while striving for growth and stability.

## Main Stories

1. **Political Instability and Electoral Challenges in MfuweNeo Simutanyi, a respected political analyst, predicts minimal chances for the Patriotic Front (PF) and Tonse Alliance to succeed in the upcoming Mfuwe by-election. The PF’s recent absence from several by-elections and internal disorganization suggest they are struggling to regain momentum after President Lungu’s era. This signals potential difficulties for opposition parties and raises questions about Zambia's political stability ahead of future polls.** 

2. **Ex-President Lungu’s Land Deal Under ScrutinyWilfred Muma, a former High Court judge, testified that late President Edgar Lungu directed the surrender of Woodlands land for a larger Airport Road property, raising concerns of abuse of power. The case implicates high-ranking officials in controversial land transactions, highlighting ongoing issues of transparency and accountability in government land dealings, especially involving Patriotic Front officials.**

3. **Anti-Corruption Agencies Under Fire Amid Allegations of Entrenched GraftThe Community Action Against Corruption (CAAC) accuses Zambia’s anti-corruption bodies of ineffectiveness, claiming that “grand corruption” persists under the UPND government. These allegations cast doubt on the country’s efforts to combat corruption, especially in light of recent reports on financial intelligence and illicit wealth accumulation, raising concerns about governance and accountability.** 

4. **Government Revenue Shortfall Signals Economic ChallengesIn the first half of 2025, Zambia collected K89 billion against a target of K91.8 billion, mainly due to reduced mineral royalties and grants. This shortfall could impact upcoming budget allocations, development projects, and economic stability, underscoring the need for diversified revenue strategies amid global demand fluctuations.** 

5. **State-Owned Enterprises Show Strong Financial PerformanceZCCM-IH shareholders approved a dividend payout of K529 million (about US$23 million), reflecting improved financial health. The substantial dividend benefits the government and stakeholders, highlighting the vital role of state enterprises in contributing to national revenue and economic stability.** 

6. **Youth Talent Gains International Attention in FootballAt the Gothia Cup 2025 in Sweden, Zambian teenagers Nthasilwe Malupande and Caleb Musonda attracted scouts from Wolves and Malmo. This indicates Zambia’s growing reputation as a producer of promising football talent, with local development programs like Chiparamba Academy playing a crucial role in nurturing future stars.**

7. **Education Support Crosses BordersA Future 4 Kids, supported by an Australian charity, has expanded from humble beginnings to educate 260 vulnerable children in Ndola. The partnership exemplifies the power of cross-border cooperation in advancing inclusive education and could inspire further international collaborations to address marginalized communities’ needs.**

8. **Football Coaching Stability at NkwaziKeegan Phiri, a long-serving assistant coach, is set to become Nkwazi Football Club’s new head coach following Aggrey Chiyangi’s departure.
