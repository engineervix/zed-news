A day marked by significant legal proceedings, strategic economic diplomacy, and distressing incidents highlights the ongoing challenges and opportunities shaping our nation. Key developments include high-profile asset forfeiture appeals, international investment drives for mineral value-addition, and tragic cases demanding justice and social reflection.

## Main Stories
1. **Dalisto Lungu Appeals State Forfeiture of 79 Vehicles and 25 Properties**  
   Dalisto Lungu has challenged the Economic and Financial Crimes Court's ruling that his properties were proceeds of crime, arguing the court relied on hearsay evidence and misapplied legal provisions. The High Court had ordered forfeiture after determining he failed to prove legitimate acquisition of assets valued at over K24 million, impacting national anti-corruption enforcement standards.

2. **Zambia Prioritizes Mineral Processing to Boost Industrialization and Regional Trade**  
   Ambassador Tobias Mulimbika emphasized Zambia’s commitment to value addition in mining during talks with Saudi Arabia’s envoy, targeting job creation and enhanced participation in Africa’s 600-million-person market. Strategic infrastructure corridors like Nacala and Dar es Salaam were highlighted as vital for unlocking investments in mining, agriculture, and energy through Public-Private Partnerships.

3. **Search Intensifies for Missing Child After Stepmother Drowns Siblings in Ngwerere River**  
   Police and Fire Brigade teams recovered the body of a six-year-old child thrown into the river by stepmother Mary Kachilika, 26, who remains in custody. Efforts continue to locate the two-year-old sibling, underscoring urgent societal concerns about child welfare and justice in Meanwood Kwamwena.

## Other Notable Stories
**Justice & Crime:**  
* Sylvia Mutaba, 52, received a 15-year sentence for concealing her husband’s death after the Lusaka High Court ruled she neglected her duty to seek medical care, leading to his skeletal remains being discovered.  

**Public Safety & Welfare:**  
* Mainza Makobela, a dismissed worker at New Matero Secondary School, attempted suicide by climbing a 45-meter communications tower, allegedly over unpaid wages, prompting a criminal trespass investigation.

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
* The outcome of Dalisto Lungu’s appeal may set precedents for non-conviction asset forfeitures, affecting future state recoveries of suspected illicit wealth.  
* Progress in mineral-processing partnerships with Saudi Arabia could accelerate industrial diversification and job opportunities in mining-dependent regions.  
* Continued search operations for the missing child in Ngwerere River remain critical for closure in a case highlighting family welfare challenges.
