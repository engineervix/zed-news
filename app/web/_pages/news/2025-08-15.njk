Zambia's political landscape sees a potential challenge to President Hichilema in 2026, while the Chipolopolo exited the CHAN tournament with three consecutive losses. Key governance issues include concerns over expired drugs, a condemned arrest of a pregnant woman, and ongoing anti-corruption efforts focused on youth vulnerability.

## Main Stories
1. Dolika Banda to Challenge HH in 2026
   Dolika Banda, former ZCCM-IH board chairperson, is set to challenge President Hakainde Hichilema in the 2026 general elections according to family sources. Talks have advanced for her to stand on an existing party platform after her resignation from ZCCM-IH in May 2023, which some attributed to political interference.

2. Chipolopolo Exit CHAN with 3 Losses
   Zambia was eliminated from the CAF African Nations Championship 2024 after a 3-1 defeat to Morocco at Nyayo Stadium in Nairobi. This marked their third consecutive loss in Group A, following earlier defeats to Congo DR and Angola, despite a consolation goal from substitute Andrew Phiri.

3. Govt Must Probe ZAMMSA’s Decision to Dispose K129m Worth Expired Drugs – CAAC
   Community Action Against Corruption (CAAC) CEO Brighton Tembo called for a government probe into ZAMMSA's process to dispose of expired medicines and medical supplies valued at K129 million. Former health minister Dr Brian Chituwo separately stated Zambia should not be a dumpsite for donated medicine with short shelf lives.

4. HRC Condemns Arbitrary Arrest of 9-Month Pregnant Woman
   The Human Rights Commission condemned the arrest of nine-month pregnant Yvonne Simpamba from her Garden House Compound home around 01:00 hours on July 24. Police officers arrested her after failing to find her husband, who was sought in connection with an alleged fraudulent land transaction case.

5. Maize Export Won’t Pose a Threat to National Food Security – MAZ
   Millers Association of Zambia president Andrew Chintala assured that the Cabinet-approved export of 501,620.1 metric tonnes of surplus maize grain will not threaten national food security. He stated stakeholders were consulted and the Food Reserve Agency would only sell surplus beyond domestic consumption needs.

6. BoZ Has Sacrificed Economic Growth by Maintaining the MPR – Chizonde
   Economist Bright Chizonde stated the Bank of Zambia sacrificed economic growth by maintaining the Monetary Policy Rate at 14.5 percent. He argued the central bank missed an opportunity to stimulate growth by increasing liquidity, prioritizing faster inflation reduction towards the 6-8 percent target range.

7. Over 400 Officer Cadets Commissioned
   President Hakainde Hichilema commissioned over 400 officer cadets, including 28 from Malawi, Namibia, and Mozambique, at the Charles Joseph Nyirenda Training School in Kafue District. He announced youths undergoing the ZNS Voluntary Skills Training Programme would get first priority in military recruitments.
