Our nation celebrates international recognition of Zambia's economic turnaround while authorities demonstrate vigilance against revenue losses, and our national football team prepares for a decisive continental match.

## Main Stories
1.  **President Hichilema Named Among World Leaders of 2025**
    The UK's Telegraph newspaper has recognised President Hakainde Hichilema as one of the World Leaders of 2025, highlighting Zambia's significant progress from being labelled an "economic basket case" to a model of reform and discipline. This honour, attributed by the President to the resilience and solidarity of the Zambian people, underscores our nation's restored global credibility achieved through difficult reforms, debt restructuring, and revitalised sectors like mining, leading to projected robust growth in 2025.
2.  **ZRA Seizes K7.8 Million in Smuggled Cigarettes**
    Zambia Revenue Authority officers intercepted a truck (registration LZ 46 TN GP) declared as carrying household goods transiting from South Africa to the DRC via Chirundu, discovering 800 cases of concealed Vikings cigarettes at a Lusaka warehouse. This seizure, preventing a K7.8 million revenue loss, demonstrates ZRA's commitment to combating smuggling and protecting national resources, with warnings issued that offenders risk losing goods, vehicles, and facing prosecution.
3.  **HH Attributes Global Recognition to Zambian Resilience**
    State House confirmed that President Hichilema views his Telegraph recognition as reflecting Zambia's rising international profile and the nation's steady economic recovery despite facing a prolonged debt crisis, COVID-19, and severe drought. The President acknowledged this as a milestone achieved through collective sacrifice, while emphasising the ongoing work needed to accelerate growth, create jobs, reduce living costs, and ensure shared prosperity for all Zambians.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Sports:** Zambia's Chipolopolo face a crucial final Group A AFCON match against hosts Morocco in Rabat today; needing a positive result to advance, as a loss coupled with a Mali win could see our unbeaten team (with two points from two games) eliminated from the tournament.

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
1.  Continued international recognition strengthens Zambia's economic credibility, potentially attracting further investment vital for sustained growth and job creation.
2.  Vigilant enforcement against smuggling and tax evasion, as demonstrated by the ZRA seizure, remains crucial for safeguarding national revenue needed for public services.
3.  The outcome of the Chipolopolo's decisive AFCON match holds significant national interest for sporting pride and continental representation.
