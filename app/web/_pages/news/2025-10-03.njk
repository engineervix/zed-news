Zambia strengthens international partnerships while advancing domestic reforms, with significant developments in energy investment, law enforcement accountability, and constitutional review processes shaping our national trajectory. Court rulings uphold fiscal policies, and concerning social issues prompt decisive governmental action to protect citizens.

## Main Stories

   President Hichilema and UK Deputy PM David Lammy agreed to expand collaboration in trade, investment, and energy during a working visit, aiming to secure reliable power for homes and businesses while creating jobs. They also discussed global stability and Zambia’s democratic progress ahead of the 2026 elections.
2. **Govt Bans Illegal Police Checkpoints Nationwide**  
   Home Affairs Minister Jack Mwiimbu ordered police to dismantle unauthorised checkpoints, requiring all designated checkpoints to be clearly marked with officers displaying name tags and service numbers to prevent public harassment. Officers violating this face dismissal, and citizens are urged to report misconduct.
3. **ConCourt Upholds 10% Tax on Betting Stakes**  
   The Constitutional Court dismissed BetPawa and Betway’s challenge against the 10% excise duty on betting stakes, ruling the tax constitutional and affirming the "pay now, argue later" principle. The decision supports ZRA’s mandate to collect revenue critical for public services.
4. **Over 5,000 Sexual Offences Recorded Since 2021**  
   Police documented 1,002 rape and 4,978 defilement cases from January 2021 to July 2025, with convictions secured for 346 rapes and 1,998 defilements. The government has banned case withdrawals by families, enhanced DNA forensics, and launched sensitisation campaigns targeting vulnerable age groups.
5. **Technical Committee Appointed for Constitutional Review**  
   President Hichilema established a 25-member committee chaired by retired Supreme Court Judge Christopher Mushabati to draft constitutional amendments after nationwide consultations. The diverse team includes legal experts, traditional leaders, and civil society representatives.
