Today's news focuses on national integrity and economic strategy, featuring developments in a high-profile investigation involving a church leader, crucial warnings for peaceful by-elections, and a landmark shift in how Zambia collects mining revenues impacting our fiscal stability.

## Main Stories
1.  **Archbishop Banda Declines Comment on Hilux During DEC Questioning**
    Archbishop Alick Banda exercised his right to remain silent when questioned by the Drug Enforcement Commission about how he acquired a Toyota Hilux (reg. ALF 7734), suspected to be unlawfully obtained from the Zambia Revenue Authority between April 2021 and December 2023; the DEC has formally warned and cautioned him as investigations continue, underscoring our nation's commitment to accountability regardless of position.
2.  **ECZ Issues Strong Warning Against Violence in Chawama, Kasama By-Elections**
    The Electoral Commission of Zambia has alerted the nation about schemes by some political parties to deploy hostile cadres aiming to disrupt the peaceful campaigns for the Chawama Parliamentary (January 15, 2026) and Kasama Mayoral (January 29, 2026) by-elections, warning that breaches of the Electoral Code of Conduct could lead to campaign suspension, vital for preserving the integrity of our democratic processes.
3.  **Zambia Pioneers Yuan Payments for Mining Taxes, Aiming for Economic Resilience**
    Zambia has become the first African nation to allow mining companies to pay statutory taxes and royalties in Chinese Yuan (Renminbi), a policy shift grounded in economic logic to align revenue collection with our major trade and investment ties with China, reducing transaction costs, unnecessary currency conversions, and pressure on the US Dollar for more efficient public finance management.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Governance & Justice:**
    *   Minister of Home Affairs Jack Mwiimbu observed that yesterday's Mass in the Lusaka Archdiocese, where a statement of solidarity with Archbishop Banda was read, resembled a political gathering, cautioning that any planned solidarity march to the DEC must obtain the necessary police permit to be legal.
    *   Minister Mwiimbu assured the nation that Archbishop Banda's constitutional rights would be fully respected despite the investigation taking on a political dimension.

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
* The outcome of the DEC investigation into the vehicle linked to the ZRA will be closely watched for its implications on governance and accountability.
* Maintaining peace and adherence to the Electoral Code of Conduct in Chawama and Kasama is critical for the credibility of the upcoming by-elections.
* The practical implementation and impact of collecting mining taxes in Yuan on our foreign exchange reserves and fiscal management requires ongoing observation.
