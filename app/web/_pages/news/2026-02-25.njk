Today's developments highlight our nation's progress and challenges, with key economic gains through reduced inflation, decisive legal actions upholding national dignity, and strategic investments in education and regional cooperation shaping Zambia's future.

## Main Stories
1. **Police Arrest NDC Official Over Coffin Image of President**  
   National Democratic Congress secretary general Mambwe Zimba was arrested and charged under Section 19(1)(a) of the Cyber Crimes Act for transmitting a deceptive Facebook image falsely depicting President Hichilema in a coffin on February 22, 2026. This firm response reinforces our commitment to lawful digital conduct and respect for national leadership.
2. **Inflation Drops to 7.5%, Easing Cost of Living**  
   Annual inflation declined from 9.4% in January to 7.5% in February 2026, driven by lower prices for cereals, fruits, vegetables, fuel, and transport. This sustained reduction from 22.8% in 2021 signals growing economic stability, directly benefiting household budgets across all provinces, especially Lusaka and Copperbelt.
3. **School Feeding Program Framed as National Economic Catalyst**  
   Professor Lubinda Haabazoka emphasises Zambia's Home-Grown School Feeding initiative as a strategic investment linking education, agriculture, and rural development. By sourcing meals locally, the program supports smallholder farmers, creates jobs, and improves learning outcomes – transforming education into an engine for broad-based economic growth.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Governance & Justice:**  
  - The State formally took possession of GBM Trucking Limited’s property on Luanshya Road, Lusaka, following a non-conviction based forfeiture order by the Economic and Financial Crimes Court, intensifying asset recovery efforts.
* **Digital Finance:**  
  - MTN Mobile Money Zambia added Konza Loans to its Kongola marketplace (*115#), enabling instant short-term credit access via MoMo wallets to support small businesses, transport needs, and education expenses nationwide.
* **Regional Cooperation:**  
  - President Hichilema urged expanded Zambia-Botswana joint investment projects during the Kazungula Bridge Authority launch, positioning the bridge as a catalyst for SADC industrialisation and trade integration.

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
* Monitor inflation trends as stabilising food and fuel prices impact household purchasing power nationwide.  
* Track implementation progress of the Home-Grown School Feeding program following its designation as a national economic priority.  
* Observe new Zambia-Botswana ventures leveraging the Kazungula Bridge to boost regional production and trade.
