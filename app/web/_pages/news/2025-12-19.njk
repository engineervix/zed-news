Today marks a significant step forward for Zambia's economic stability and a moment of political reckoning, as the nation secures crucial international financial support while witnessing decisive actions within a major opposition party regarding parliamentary conduct.

## Main Stories
1.  **IMF Approves Final US$190 Million Disbursement to Zambia**
    The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Zambian authorities reached a Staff-Level Agreement to complete the Sixth and Final Review under our Extended Credit Facility (ECF), unlocking a final disbursement of about US$190 million. This brings total IMF support since August 2022 to US$1.7 billion, affirming the progress of our nation's economic reform program despite global and domestic challenges.
2.  **PF Expels MPs Over Vote on Bill 7**
    Patriotic Front (PF) acting president Given Lubinda announced the immediate expulsion from the party of all PF Members of Parliament who voted in favour of the contentious Bill 7 of 2025 in the National Assembly. Mr Lubinda stated these MPs defied clear party instructions, describing their actions as a betrayal of the party and the Zambian people, akin to "a stab in the back," and directed all PF structures nationwide to note their changed status.
