Today's developments highlight key areas of national progress and concern, from agricultural exports boosting our economy to crucial investments in mental healthcare and ongoing efforts to maintain currency stability, all while addressing justice matters and celebrating sporting achievements.

## Main Stories
1. **Government Advised to Proceed with Maize Export Deal to Malawi**  
   The National Association of Smallholder Farmers (NASF) has urged the government to proceed with the government-to-government maize export deal to Malawi, as it will boost production and business growth for smallholder farmers. NASF President Frank Kayula confirmed the deal's attractiveness and highlighted its potential to generate revenue, enabling the Food Reserve Agency (FRA) to settle outstanding payments owed to farmers.
2. **Government Prioritizes Mental Health Investment**  
   President Hakainde Hichilema affirmed the government's commitment to tackling mental health challenges through strengthened investments in education and healthcare systems. Speaking via Health Minister Elijah Muchima at the eighth mental health forum in Lusaka, the President emphasized that building capacity in these sectors is essential for addressing risks affecting Zambia's population.
3. **Kwacha Stability Linked to Export Tracking Framework**  
   Economic experts attribute the Kwacha's appreciation and stability to the Export Proceeds Tracking Framework (EPTF), operational since January, which ensures Zambia receives revenue from exports. Twaambo Hamusute explained that this framework increased US Dollar supply on the local market, reducing pressure on our currency and contributing to broader economic stability.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Governance & Justice:**  
    *   The Lusaka Magistrate’s Court denied bail to social media personality Francis Kapwepwe ("Why Me"), charged with hate speech, after Acting Chief Resident Magistrate Ireen Phiri ruled him a flight risk due to inconsistent addresses and an unlawful exit from the country.
    *   The Government clarified misinformation regarding police involvement at a Christian gathering at the Olympic Youth Development Centre (OYDC) planned for October 23, 2025, confirming Permanent Secretary Thabo Kawana stated organisers dispersed congregants themselves after being advised to reschedule.
    *   Forensic analyst Inspector Isaac Kalimanshila testified in the Lusaka High Court that the bullet recovered from former IBA director general Guntila Muleya was fired from an AK-47 rifle, based on ballistic analysis conducted by the Department of National Forensic Sciences and Biometrics.
* **Sports:**  
    *   Chipata United registrar Cornelius Ngulube received a one-year ban from the Eastern Province FAZ Disciplinary Committee for registering four ineligible players (Edward Kumwenda, James Kumwenda, Frank Banda, Innocent Nyasulu) using forged documents for a Week Five fixture.
    *   Kansanshi Dynamos handed its technical bench a three-game ultimatum to secure nine points (with a minimum of seven) following poor results, while also condemning fan violence during their Week Nine 1-1 draw against Mines United.
    *   Zambia's Copper Queens coach Nora Häuptle assured fans the team will perform better at the 2026 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco, aiming for 2027 FIFA World Cup qualification, following their 7-2 aggregate victory over Namibia.
