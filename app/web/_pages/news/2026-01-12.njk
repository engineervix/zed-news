Today's news reflects our nation's progress in electoral preparation, education access expansion, and public safety vigilance, alongside reassuring health advisories and sobering reminders about infrastructure protection and road safety.

## Main Stories
1. **ECZ Advances Constituency Delimitation Ahead of 2026 Polls**  
   The Electoral Commission of Zambia is finalizing preparatory work for constituency delimitation, engaging stakeholders to complete the process before the April 30, 2026 voter register certification. This foundational exercise ensures fair political representation for all Zambians in the upcoming general elections.

2. **Itezhi-Tezhi Form One Placement Success for All 1,533 Pupils**  
   Through classroom upgrades, double-session arrangements, and optimized capacity, every pupil in Itezhi-Tezhi District secured secondary school placement without disrupting primary learners. This solution addresses enrolment pressures from free education gains, with over 40 new classroom blocks built locally in two years and 120+ national World Bank infrastructure projects underway to sustainably expand access.

3. **Zambia Excluded from Nestlé Infant Formula Contamination Scare**  
   Health authorities confirm Zambia did not import batches of Nestlé NAN Special Pro 0–12 months formula potentially contaminated with cereulide cereus toxin. Enhanced market surveillance by inspectors nationwide ensures continued safety for our infants, with the public urged to report any sightings through official channels.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Governance & Justice:**  
  - ECZ clarified that provisional voter data (8.8 million) combines the certified 2021 register (7.07 million) and new registrations (1.78 million), dismissing claims of discrepancies as misleading during ongoing verification.
* **Law & Order:**  
  - Three suspects, including a juvenile, were arrested in Lusaka’s Chinika area with stolen ZESCO copper cables and four vehicles (Toyota Noah ALP 9906, Vitz BBC 4730, Runx BBE 3380, unregistered Auris) in a January 10 police operation.
* **Road Safety:**  
  - Four died near Kapiringozi on January 11 when an Iveco truck (AJC 386) overturned after speeding on the Chirundu-Kafue road. Bodies are at Mtendere Mission Hospital mortuary.

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
* ECZ’s timely delimitation and voter register processes are critical milestones for electoral credibility.
* Education infrastructure investments will progressively ease secondary school access in high-growth districts.
* Vigilance against copper theft and adherence to speed limits remain vital for national infrastructure and citizen safety.
