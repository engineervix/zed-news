5. **üíé[Local Miners Demand Priority in Gold License Allocation]**

6. **üí∞[Mbula Urges Civil Servants to "Live Within Means" Amid Austerity]**  
   Former Cabinet Secretary Mbula links personal debt to corruption, urging 200,000+ civil servants toward fiscal prudence. The advice highlights wage stagnation against inflation (now 13.2%) and underscores anti-graft messaging.  

7. **üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è[Uncle Faces 15+ Years for Serial Defilement of Niece]**
