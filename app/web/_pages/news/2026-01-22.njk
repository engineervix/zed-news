Zambia's legal processes and crime enforcement take center stage today, with significant court developments involving a prominent politician and effective police actions against fraud and theft impacting citizen security and business confidence.

## Main Stories
1. **MP Miles Samba Granted Bail in ECZ Case**
   Matero MP Miles Samba pleaded not guilty at the Lusaka Magistrate’s Court to charges of spreading allegedly false information via computer system about the Electoral Commission of Zambia (ECZ) setting up a fake polling station in Chawama. Magistrate Webster Milumbe granted him K1 million bail in his own recognizance, requiring two working sureties within Lusaka also bound to K1 million, with trial set to begin next month, highlighting the application of the Cyber Crimes Act to public figures and electoral discourse.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Governance & Justice:**
    *   Matero MP Miles Samba spent a second night in police detention following his arrest on Tuesday for alleged transmission of deceptive communication under the Cyber Crimes Act of 2025, stemming from claims about a fake polling station in Lilayi on his Facebook page. His lawyer, Celestin Mukandila, expressed concern over the continued detention despite reportedly meeting police bond conditions, contrasting it with President Hichilema's stance on prolonged detention for bondable offences.
* **Crime & Justice:**
    *   Egyptian national police arrested Khalid Elsayed Aboulenine at East Park Mall in Lusaka on January 21, 2026, for allegedly obtaining US$10,000 by false pretences from fellow Egyptian Muhammed Abouzid in January 2022 under the guise of establishing a furniture business. He is detained at Matero Police Station awaiting court.
* **Regional Crime:**
    *   Police in Chingola arrested 20-year-old unemployed youth John Nkhoma for breaking into Descent Distributors Wholesale Shop in the Mwaiseni Trading Area on Tuesday morning, stealing property and cash valued at K81,627, including a K15,000 DVR and K65,027 cash. Security guards alerted police, leading to his apprehension and the recovery of all stolen items, with CCTV footage confirming he acted alone.

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
* Monitor the upcoming trial of MP Miles Samba under the Cyber Crimes Act, as its outcome will set precedent for online communication standards concerning national institutions like the ECZ.
* Observe the court proceedings for the Egyptian national accused of the US$10,000 fraud, reflecting on Zambia's commitment to tackling transnational financial crimes affecting investors.
