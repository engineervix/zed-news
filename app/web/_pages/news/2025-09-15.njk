Today’s news highlights Zambia's resilience amid continental debt advocacy, critical steps to safeguard our agriculture, and progress in economic stability and energy security. These developments shape our path toward sustainable growth and national well-being.

## Main Stories
1. **Africa’s Call for Debt Reparations Gains Momentum**  
   African policymakers and civil society rallied in Ghana demanding World Bank and IMF debt cancellation, citing Africa’s public debt surge to US$2.14 trillion in 2024 and US$165 billion in debt servicing costs this year alone. This unified stance resonates deeply with Zambia’s own debt restructuring efforts and our fight for fiscal sovereignty.

2. **Stricter Laws Against Fake Farming Inputs Introduced**  
   Agriculture Minister Reuben Mtolo announced legislation to make selling counterfeit seeds and fertilizers a non-bailable offense. Agro-dealer Enock Phiri praised the move, noting fake inputs devastate small-scale farmers through poor germination and soil damage, directly threatening our food security and agricultural livelihoods.

3. **ZESCO Extends Daily Power Supply to Six Hours**  
   Following system stabilization efforts amid Maamba Energy’s maintenance, ZESCO increased electricity access for residential customers to six hours daily while adjusting schedules for industrial users. This offers tangible relief to households and businesses navigating prolonged load-shedding.

4. **Historic Maize Harvest Boosts National Food Security**  
   Zambia achieved a record 3.7-million-tonne maize harvest through reformed Farmer Input Support Programme policies, including digital vouchers and private-sector partnerships. This surplus positions our nation as an emerging regional agricultural powerhouse, with a 10-million-tonne target by 2030 now within reach.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Governance & Justice:**  
  - ZRA seized K3.7 million and $3,091 from non-compliant Kasempa mining firms, arresting Sino Octascene’s director for attempting to bribe an officer with K10,000 during the raid.
* **Economic Diversification:**  
  - Climate finance facilities like British International Investment’s US$50 million loan to ZANACO offer MSMEs opportunities to adopt renewable energy and efficiency upgrades under Zambia’s Green Economy Act.
  - Corporate policies ignoring women’s health—such as unmanaged diabetes or PCOS affecting productivity—risk undermining workforce potential despite their significant representation.
* **Resource Management:**  
  - Government plans 90% livestock vaccination coverage and new vaccine plants to develop a US$1 billion beef export industry, enhancing rural incomes.

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
* Monitor ZESCO’s progress in sustaining extended power supply beyond September 21, when Maamba Energy’s maintenance concludes.
* Track implementation of the stricter counterfeit-inputs law ahead of the 2025/2026 farming season to protect farmer investments.
* Observe uptake of climate finance by MSMEs following ZANACO’s deployment of the US$50 million BII facility for green projects.
