Zambia's current landscape is marked by a vibrant mix of sporting achievements, political tensions, economic initiatives, and ongoing social issues. As the nation celebrates its football successes and prepares for upcoming elections, concerns over illegal mining, public safety, and governance continue to shape the national discourse. Key developments include Zambia's historic progress in women's football, strategic political positioning ahead of 2026, and efforts to strengthen traditional and community institutions.

## Main Stories

1. **Zambia’s Copper Queens Make Historic WAFCON Quarterfinals**The Zambia women's national team has advanced to the quarterfinals of the CAF Women's Africa Cup of Nations for only the second time, after a narrow 1-0 victory over DRC. Coach Nora Häuptle's team is now positioned to challenge stronger opponents, boosting the profile of women's football in Zambia and inspiring greater regional investment and participation. This milestone signals growing competitiveness and could catalyze future support for women's sports nationwide.**

2. **Political Strategy in Mfuwe By-Elections Sparks Division**The opposition's decision for the Socialist Party and Tonse Alliance to field separate candidates in the upcoming Mfuwe parliamentary by-elections has raised concerns over opposition unity. The ruling UPND views this fragmentation as a sign of disorganization that may weaken the opposition's challenge in both the by-election and the 2026 general elections. Analysts suggest this split could benefit the ruling party, which is leveraging its incumbency advantage as opposition parties struggle to present a united front.**

3. **Government’s Focus on Traditional Leaders as Infrastructure Boosts Community Status**Senior Chief Chikwanda praises the government's initiative to build palaces for chiefs, arguing that better accommodations will elevate their status and improve community relations. This move underscores the government’s strategy to empower traditional authorities, potentially strengthening local governance and fostering respect for cultural institutions across Zambia’s rural and peri-urban areas.**

4. **Economic and Security Measures: Fighting Illegal Mining and Improving Telecoms**President Hakainde Hichilema has ordered immediate action to curb illegal mining, citing safety and national security threats. Meanwhile, Airtel Zambia faces sanctions from ZICTA for service outages but commits to investing in network upgrades to enhance customer experience. These actions reflect government priorities of ensuring safer economic activities and reliable digital infrastructure essential for development.**

5. **Post-Election Divisions and Calls for PF Deregistration**Chief Chikaza Munyama has urged the Registrar of Societies to deregister the Patriotic Front (PF), citing its refusal to accept electoral defeat and perceived threat to national unity. This controversy highlights ongoing political tensions and concerns over stability, as the country prepares for the 2026 elections amid accusations of divisiveness and post-election bitterness.**

6. **International and Local Sports Movements: From Football to Footballers Abroad**Zambian striker Kennedy Musonda has signed with Israeli club Hapoel Ramat Gan, reflecting the increasing presence of Zambian talent in international leagues. Additionally, Nigeria’s women’s team seeks revenge against Zambia in the WAFCON quarterfinals, promising a fiercely contested match that could decide regional dominance and influence future African women’s football competitions.**

7. **Community and Social Initiatives: Fun Runs and Public Safety**Solwezi’s Unifi Fun Run attracted over 2,500 participants, strengthening community bonds and promoting healthy lifestyles. Conversely, a tragic incident in Mufulira involved a woman dying after a violent assault by a club DJ, raising concerns about gender-based violence and safety in entertainment venues. These stories reflect Zambia’s ongoing efforts to promote community well-being while addressing social challenges.**

8. **Lusaka’s Diplomatic and Cultural Developments**The Lungu family’s petition to South Africa’s High Court to involve Minister Ronald Ramola in Edgar Lungu’s burial case underscores the complex interplay of international relations and human rights. Meanwhile, traditional leadership is being reinforced through new palace constructions, emphasizing the government’s recognition of cultural heritage as a pillar of national identity.**

## Brief Updates
