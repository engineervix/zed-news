Zambia's stock exchange leads global performance with a 56% index surge, while media institutions face calls to establish AI usage policies amid growing adoption. Healthcare access expands through new hospital infrastructure, and debates intensify over legalizing motorcycles for transport alongside high-profile corruption sentencing.

## Main Stories
1. **LuSE Ranks Among World's Top Performing Stock Markets**  
   Lusaka Securities Exchange's main index rose 56% between January and August 2025, outperforming Nigeria (40%), Ghana (45%), and Johannesburg (25%). CEO Nicholas Kabaso cited investor confidence, corporate results in energy/mining, and falling bond yields (down from 34% to 20%) as key drivers, with Copperbelt Energy Corporation and ZCCM reaching US$1 billion market capitalization.

2. **WAN-IFRA Urges AI Policies for Zambian Media**  
   WAN-IFRA Women in News executive director Susan Makore called for clear AI guidelines as 60% of journalists already use tools like text analytics and chatbots. The appeal followed a Lusaka training attended by senior reporters and Editors' Forum representatives, emphasizing ethical practices amid concerns about authenticity.

3. **JICA Partnership Delivers Seven Upgraded Hospitals**  
   Over 2.5 million Zambians will benefit from seven modernized Level-1 hospitals across Lusaka and Copperbelt, completed through JICA's US$32 million investment. Upgrades include surgical capacity at Chilenje, Matero, Chawama, Chipata, Kanyama (Lusaka), plus Mushili and Chamboli hospitals (Copperbelt), with enhanced maternal and emergency services.

4. **Government Considers Legalizing Motorcycles for Public Transport**  
   Following the Health Ministry's tri-wheel ambulance initiative, policymakers are evaluating legalizing two/three-wheelers for everyday transport. The Road Transport and Safety Agency noted motorcycles are already a "lifeline" in Eastern Province, proposing regulation and safety training to address rural mobility and urban congestion.

5. **Malanji, Yamba Sentenced; State Seizes Assets**  
   Former Foreign Affairs Minister Joseph Malanji received four years imprisonment for possessing property from suspected crime proceeds, while ex-Treasury Secretary Fredson Yamba got three years for procurement irregularities. The State applied to forfeit Malanji’s Bell helicopters, three Silverest Gardens homes, and US$215,000 cash.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Governance & Justice:**  
  - Speaker Nelly Mutti noted chiefs in Muchinga Province support resuming constitutional review, awaiting Executive action.  
  - Lusaka Magistrate Court denied bail to TikToker Francis "Why Me" Kapwepwe, charged with hate speech, citing flight risk after prisoners allegedly assaulted him for "insulting Tongas."
* **Economy & Infrastructure:**  
  - Bank of Zambia reported withdrawing 48% of old currency, with K14 billion new notes issued and K8 billion old notes remaining.  
  - Energy Minister Makozo Chikote directed Indeni and Tazama Pipeline to prevent fuel shortages through proactive distribution.
* **Crime & Society:**  
  - Siavonga police seek Grevalate Sikakooze for allegedly defiling a 7-year-old girl on September 2 in Namoomba Village.

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
* LuSE’s performance potentially advancing Zambia’s "frontier market" bid by 2030.  
* Regulatory decisions on motorcycle legalization following RTSA’s Eastern Province pilot.  
* Continued asset forfeiture proceedings against convicted officials.
