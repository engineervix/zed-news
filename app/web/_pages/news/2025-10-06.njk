**Today's news highlights our nation's steadfast commitment to national unity alongside tangible efforts to uplift vulnerable citizens, as government leaders and institutions unite in condemning divisive tribalism while expanding crucial social support programs.**

## Main Stories
1. **National Leaders Unite Against Tribal Rhetoric**  
   Minister Chipoka Mulenga condemned tribalism from any political party, specifically referencing alleged tribal remarks by former PF deputy secretary general Mumba Phiri in a viral audio. Such divisive talk risks reversing Zambia’s hard-won peace and unity, directly challenging our foundational principle of "One Zambia, One Nation."

2. **Social Cash Transfer Expansion Targets Vulnerable Households**  
   President Hichilema announced scaling up the Social Cash Transfer program to reach 16,385 beneficiary households in 2025—a 55% increase from 2022—demonstrating the government’s intensified focus on alleviating socio-economic hardships for underprivileged Zambians.

3. **VP Calls on Church to Champion Tribal Diversity**  
   Vice-President Mutale-Nalumango urged religious leaders to actively promote acceptance of all tribes, emphasizing that God’s creation of diverse cultures should be celebrated, not undermined. This reinforces national efforts to foster social cohesion from grassroots levels.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Governance & Justice:**  
  - State House Special Assistant Joseph Lungu warned against tribal politicking, stating it dishonors Zambia’s 60-year independence legacy and threatens economic progress under the New Dawn administration.

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
* Implementation progress of the expanded Social Cash Transfer program reaching 16,385 households by 2025.  
* Continued advocacy from all governance pillars (executive, opposition, religious) against divisive tribal narratives.  
* Scrutiny of political discourse aligning with national unity principles ahead of 2026 elections.
