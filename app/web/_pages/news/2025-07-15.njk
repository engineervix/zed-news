Today’s Zambian news digest highlights a tense political landscape, ongoing legal battles over constitutional reforms, and a focus on economic development and sports. The nation is grappling with questions of governance, constitutional integrity, and the future direction of its democracy, while also celebrating progress in sports and economic initiatives.

## Main Stories

1. **Patriotic Front Plans Post-Funeral Convention to Reunify OppositionThe Patriotic Front (PF) intends to hold its convention immediately after the burial of former President Edgar Lungu, aiming to present a united front ahead of future elections.**  
This move signals PF’s strategic attempt to consolidate leadership and strengthen its position against the ruling UPND. A unified opposition could significantly influence Zambia’s political dynamics, especially as the country approaches the 2026 elections, potentially challenging UPND's dominance and reshaping political competition.

2. **Legal Clash Over Bill 7 Revives Constitutional TensionsLAZ and opposition figures argue that the Speaker’s attempt to revive Bill 7 violates the Supreme Court’s previous ruling, emphasizing constitutional supremacy.**  
The Law Association of Zambia (LAZ) and critics like Linda Kasonde contend that only the Constitutional Court has authority over constitutional interpretation, raising concerns about the separation of powers. The dispute underscores ongoing struggles to uphold legal and constitutional standards amid political maneuvering.

3. **Government’s Gold Mining Strategy Under ScrutinyMining expert Edward Simukonda claims Zambia’s state-owned ZCCM-IH can independently manage gold mining, challenging government plans to partner with foreign investors.**  
This debate reflects broader questions about resource management and economic sovereignty. If the government follows Simukonda’s advice, Zambia could retain greater control over its mineral wealth, potentially boosting local revenue and sovereignty.

4. **Opposition Brags of Dominance Amid Political DeclineUPND members assert they have no real competitors, dismissing opposition threats and claiming political supremacy.**  
This confidence signals UPND’s desire to consolidate power, but also raises concerns about democratic competition and political pluralism in Zambia, especially as opposition voices warn of fragmentation and weakened alternatives.

The increased corporate support and team confidence highlight the rising profile of Zambian football. Success in regional tournaments and investment in sports infrastructure could inspire national unity and pride.

6. **Diplomatic Negotiations Surround Lungu Family and RepatriationFormer Vice-President Kavindele reveals regional leaders offered to drop cases against Lungu’s family in exchange for repatriating his remains, exposing complex diplomatic negotiations.**

7. **President Hichilema Commits to Corruption Fight in Medical Supplies SectorHichilema emphasizes accountability, with investigations leading to the dissolution of ZAMMSA’s board, reflecting a zero-tolerance approach to corruption.**  
This crackdown aims to improve transparency and ensure fair distribution of medical supplies, which is critical for public health and governance reforms.

8. **LAZ Sues Over Bill 7, Citing Constitutional ViolationsThe Law Association challenges the Speaker’s ruling, seeking to prevent unconstitutional legislative actions.**  
This legal challenge underscores ongoing efforts to uphold constitutional integrity and prevent legislative overreach, emphasizing Zambia’s commitment to the rule of law.

9. **Chishimba Kambwili Jailed for Hate SpeechThe outspoken politician receives a five-month sentence for tribal remarks, highlighting efforts to curb hate speech and promote national unity.**  
Kambwili’s incarceration signals a strong stance against divisive rhetoric, but also raises broader debates on free speech and political dissent.

10. **Small-Scale Mining Urged for Economic GrowthESMAZ calls for supportive policies to empower local miners, especially amid recent gold rushes, to maximize sector benefits.**  
Strengthening small-scale mining could diversify Zambia’s economy, create jobs, and foster local enterprise, crucial for sustainable development.
