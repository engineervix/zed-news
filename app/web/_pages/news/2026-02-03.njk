Our nation sees positive economic strides as manufacturers reduce prices in response to the Kwacha's strength, while significant developments unfold in digital finance with the launch of a new insurance platform. Key electoral preparations commence this week, and Zambia's trade position strengthens, reflecting growing macroeconomic stability.

## Main Stories
1.  **Manufacturers Reduce Commodity Prices by 5-20%**
    Responding to government directives and the continued appreciation of the Kwacha, 30 local companies representing 76% of our manufacturing sector have lowered prices of essential commodities, offering tangible relief to Zambian households facing the cost of living.
2.  **FNB Pays 38,000 FISP Farmers, Awaits 5,000 More**
    First National Bank Zambia has disbursed payments to 38,000 farmers participating in the crucial Farmer Input Support Programme for the 2024-2025 season, supporting our agricultural backbone and food security, with payments pending for the remaining 5,000 farmers once lists are received from the Food Reserve Agency.
3.  **MTN MoMo Launches Digital Insurance Marketplace**
    MTN Mobile Money Zambia has introduced a new insurance marketplace via USSD *115#, partnering with Mzanu Financial Services and Master Business Associates to offer accessible health and motor insurance, simplifying processes and expanding financial protection options for Zambians nationwide.
4.  **ECZ Launches Constituency Delimitation Exercise Friday**
    The Electoral Commission of Zambia (ECZ) will officially commence the critical delimitation exercise this Friday, February 6th, at the Mulungushi International Conference Centre, a process fundamental to creating additional constituencies and shaping the framework for our 2026 General Elections.
5.  **Musokotane Reports Stronger Zambian Trade Position**
    Finance Minister Situmbeko Musokotwane highlighted that Zambia's international merchandise trade figures for January-December 2025 indicate a stronger external trade position, signalling the steady normalisation of trade flows as our nation's macroeconomic stability takes hold.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Governance & Justice:**
    *   Christian Democratic Party president Daniel Pule's sedition trial was again adjourned yesterday (Lusaka Chief Resident Magistrate Sylvia Munyinya-Okoh) after his defence lawyer, Major Hanzala Mwaaba (Rtd), presented a medical report stating Mr. Pule was unfit for trial and required four weeks of bed rest. The case resumes today.
* **Workplace Safety:**
    *   Christopher Katongo, a 28-year-old miner employed by Reliant Mining Company (a Mopani Copper Mines contractor), tragically died on Saturday at the 1,507-metre level shaft in Mufulira after being run over by a boomer machine operated by a colleague. Copperbelt Police Commanding Officer Mwala Yuyi confirmed the incident is under investigation.
* **Sports:**
    *   Zambia's Futsal team, under coach Andrea Cristoforetti, prepares for a tough CAF 2026 Futsal AFCON qualifying first leg match against hosts Ghana today at the University of Cape Coast Sports Hall in Accra, with the return leg scheduled for February 8th in Lusaka.

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
* Monitor the implementation and breadth of manufacturer price reductions across retail outlets to assess the real impact on household budgets.
* Track the efficiency of the Food Reserve Agency in submitting the final lists of 5,000 FISP farmers to FNB Zambia to ensure timely payments.
* Observe the accessibility and uptake of the new MTN MoMo insurance services as a measure of progress in digital financial inclusion.
