Today’s news digest highlights Zambia’s ongoing political developments, economic adjustments, governance reforms, and societal issues. The focus remains on strengthening accountability, addressing internal political tensions, and improving public service and economic stability amid rising living costs and societal debates. Key stories underline Zambia’s efforts to foster transparency, reform institutions, and navigate political and social challenges.

## Main Stories

1. **UPND Denies Agreement with Sangwa Over Alleged Betrayal**
The United Party for National Development (UPND) has publicly distanced itself from constitutional lawyer John Sangwa’s claims that President Hakainde Hichilema betrayed him. The party emphasizes that no formal agreement was made with Sangwa regarding the president’s constitutional amendments, highlighting a growing rift between the party and Sangwa. This dispute risks damaging the UPND’s reputation and could impact its support base, especially as internal disagreements surface over governance strategies and campaign promises.

2. **Cabinet Approves Bill for Teacher Licensure Exams Amid Education Reforms**
The Zambian Cabinet has approved legislation to introduce licensure exams for teachers, signaling a strategic move to improve education standards. This reform aims to professionalize teaching and ensure better quality education nationwide. The policy reflects a broader government effort to strengthen institutional frameworks and address concerns about teacher competency, which is critical for Zambia’s long-term development.

3. **Cost of Living Rises by K490.41, Reflecting Economic Pressures**
Zambia’s inflationary pressures continue to affect ordinary citizens, with the cost of living increasing significantly. The latest figures indicate a rise of K490.41, exacerbating financial strain on households. This development underscores the urgent need for economic reforms and targeted social support to cushion vulnerable populations against inflation’s impact.

4. **Deputy AG Announces Focus on Current Audits, Signaling Transparency Gains**
Deputy Auditor General Stella Nyonda disclosed that Zambia’s Office of the Auditor General is now prioritizing current financial audits rather than backdated ones. This shift aligns with President Hichilema’s stance that audits from eight years ago are less beneficial. The move aims to improve fiscal accountability and transparency, fostering better governance and public trust in government financial management.

5. **Internal Political Tensions Surface in Parliament over Party Discipline**
The Patriotic Front (PF) faces ongoing internal strife, with Kapyanga urging the Speaker to allow free debate among MPs. Speaker Nelly Mutti called on the party to "put their house in order," highlighting disorder within PF’s ranks. These tensions reflect the fragile unity ahead of next year’s elections and underscore challenges within opposition politics, which could influence legislative stability and governance.

6. **FAZ Embarks on Reforms with FIFA Workshop to Strengthen Football Governance**

President Keith Mweemba emphasizes translating these lessons into tangible progress, aiming to professionalize Zambia’s football development and attract future investments. This initiative signals a strategic push towards sports excellence and institutional integrity.

7. **Zambia International Trade Fair Highlights Government’s Role in Policy and Economic Growth**
