Today's developments highlight key strides in economic sovereignty through the conclusion of our IMF programme, the reaffirmation of national standards in education, and leadership's commitment to inclusive governance as we advance towards national goals.

## Main Stories
1.  **Zambia Concludes IMF Programme, Prioritises Growth Agenda**  
    Finance Minister Situmbeko Musokotwane confirmed Zambia will not seek a one-year extension of its IMF Extended Credit Facility, opting instead to transition towards a growth-focused agenda aimed at accelerating investment, job creation, and expanding our economy's productive capacity. This deliberate shift builds on the fiscal discipline foundation laid since 2022 and signals our nation's commitment to self-directed economic expansion and diversification.
2.  **Ministry Enforces Uniform School Calendar for Private Institutions**  
    The Ministry of Education has directed private schools following the Zambian National Curriculum to close and reopen on January 12, 2026, aligning with the official calendar, after some opened early on January 5th. Permanent Secretary Kelvin Mambwe warned that non-compliance risks licence revocation, ensuring uniformity and adherence to national educational standards across all institutions serving our children.
3.  **President Hichilema Reaffirms Commitment to Service Ahead of Elections**  
    Addressing a large gathering in Choma, President Hakainde Hichilema stated his administration's dedication stems from "deep love and genuine care" for Zambians, reaffirming his resolve to work tirelessly for all citizens as the August elections approach. He acknowledged progress made while stressing the need for continued citizen confidence and support to overcome remaining challenges and deliver further results for our nation.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Governance & Justice:** Opposition Patriotic Front Members of Parliament were among those attending the Choma event and offered words of support for President Hichilema during his address.

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
* Implementation of the post-IMF growth-focused economic agenda, including strict adherence to the approved national budget and planned negotiations for a longer-term IMF successor programme focused on structural reforms.
* Monitoring by Ministry of Education standards officers to ensure nationwide compliance with the uniform school calendar directive for private institutions.
* Continued focus on national unity and service delivery as emphasised by the President, setting the tone for the period leading to the August elections.
