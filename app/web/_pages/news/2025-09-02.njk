Today's news highlights law enforcement responses to allegations, political figures discussing governance accountability, and national team preparations for upcoming World Cup qualifiers. Economic developments include fuel price adjustments and export growth, while legal proceedings advance against former public officials.

## Main Stories
1. Police Deny Kapwepwe Abduction Claims  
   Zambia Police Spokesperson Rae Hamoonga dismissed allegations that officers abducted Francis "Why Me" Kapwepwe from Zimbabwe, stating apprehensions follow lawful processes. He emphasized that evidence should be discussed in court, not public debates.

2. Mutati Advises Apology for Unfulfilled Promises  
   Science Minister Felix Mutati urged newly elected Mfuwe MP Malama Mufunelo to apologize to constituents if he fails to deliver campaign pledges. Mutati noted that unfulfilled promises sometimes result from circumstances beyond politicians' control.

3. Chipolopolo Squad Assembles for Morocco Match  
   Players including Frankie Musonda, Gift Siame, and goalkeepers Mwenya Chibwe and Toaster Nsabata arrived in Ndola for FIFA World Cup qualifiers. Fitness tests will be conducted before finalizing the 24-man squad for Monday's game against Morocco.

4. Lusambo Sentenced for Illicit Property  
   Former Lusaka Minister Bowman Lusambo received a three-year prison sentence with hard labor for possessing properties worth K22 million deemed proceeds of crime. Magistrate Davies Chibwili cited bogus businesses used to hide illegitimate earnings.

5. Fuel Price Hike Deemed Reasonable  
   OMCAZ President Dr. Kafula Mubanga described ERB's fuel price increases—petrol to K29.18/liter and diesel to K25.02/liter—as necessary to ensure supply stability. He noted previous prices were uncompetitive for oil marketing companies.

6. ZESCO Ndola Girls Secure COSAFA Silver  
   ZESCO MD Justin Loongo commended ZESCO Ndola Girls for winning silver at the COSAFA Women’s Championship, falling 4–3 on penalties to Botswana’s Gaborone United Ladies. The achievement followed a 1–1 draw after extra time.
