Zambia's legal landscape featured several significant court cases today, including a student pleading guilty to marijuana trafficking and five suspects charged with murder. Economic developments included an inflation rate drop to 12.6% and new government mandates for cooperatives seeking empowerment funds, while public health efforts saw 6.4 million condoms distributed ahead of the Kulamba ceremony.

## Main Stories
1. Student in court for trafficking marijuana  
   Gabriel Shula, a 29-year-old student, pleaded guilty in Lusaka Magistrates’ Court to trafficking 14 sachets of marijuana. He was apprehended on July 15 by Drug Enforcement Commission officers after reports of suspected drug dealing.

2. Cooperatives mandated to produce annual returns to access empowerment  
   Small and Medium Enterprise Development Minister Elias Mubanga announced cooperatives must submit proof of annual returns to receive government empowerment funds.

   The Ministry of Community Development is introducing an online Non-Governmental Registration Information Management System (NGORims) to improve NGO registration and data management. The system, effective by Q3 2025, was detailed by Department of Registrar for NGOs Senior Standards Officer Martin Kaonga at a Kabwe workshop.

4. Inflation drops to 12.6%  
   Zambia’s annual inflation decreased to 12.6% in August 2025 from 13.0% in July, driven by price movements in food and non-food items. Lusaka Province contributed most to inflation at 3.9 percentage points, while cumulative January-July 2025 trade reached K376.1 billion.

5. Police charge Maria Zaloumis, partner, 3 others with murder  
   Police jointly charged Maria Zaloumis, her Nigerian husband Nathaniel Barthrem, and three others with the murder of 22-year-old Enock Simfukwe Kasengele. The arrest followed concluded investigations by Chowa Police Station in Kabwe.

6. ZAMMSA releases 6.4m condoms ahead of Kulamba  
   Zambia Medicines and Medical Supplies Agency distributed 6.4 million condoms to Eastern Province for the August 30, 2025 Kulamba Traditional Ceremony. The initiative aims to prevent STIs, HIV/AIDS, and unplanned pregnancies during the event.

7. All passengers safe as Power Tools bus burns on Great North Road
