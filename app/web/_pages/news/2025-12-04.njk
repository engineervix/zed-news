Today's news reflects our collective focus on security, economic progress, and national unity. Significant developments include progress in a high-profile criminal investigation, reassurances on key economic partnerships and athlete welfare, and crucial national conversations around constitutional processes and voter participation.

## Main Stories
1.  **Arrests Made in Lusaka Chinese Couple Murder Case**  
    Zambia Police have arrested three suspects connected to the December 3rd/4th murder and robbery of a Chinese business couple at their Lusaka home, recovering the stolen vehicle used in the Kamwala Trading Centre incident. This swift action demonstrates our law enforcement's commitment to justice and community safety, vital for maintaining public trust and investor confidence.
2.  **Musokotwane Defends TAZARA Concession as Revenue Booster**  
    Finance Minister Dr. Situmbeko Musokotwane stated in the National Assembly that the TAZARA concession agreement will generate tax revenue and concession shares for Zambia, contrasting it with the previous model where Treasury funded salaries. This shift aims to transform the railway from a fiscal drain into a sustainable asset contributing to our national coffers.
3.  **Government Commits to Paying Copper Queens' Outstanding Allowances**  
    Sports Minister Elvis Nkandu reaffirmed the government's commitment to settling all outstanding allowances owed to the Copper Queens for qualifying for the 2026 WAFCON, following their protest in Malawi. Ensuring our national heroes receive their dues is crucial for athlete morale and upholding the pride we take in their achievements.
4.  **Debate Intensifies Over Voter Registration Deadline**  
    Former ECZ chief Patrick Nshindano has called for an extension of the voter registration period, arguing the commission hasn't met its target and risks disenfranchising citizens, while government maintains the closure stands. This directly impacts every Zambian's fundamental right to participate in shaping our democracy through the ballot box.
5.  **Oasis Forum Criticizes Process Despite Finding Merit in Bill 7**  
    Oasis Forum Chairperson Beauty Katebe acknowledged "a lot of good things" in Constitutional Amendment Bill 7 but emphasized the amendment process itself is fundamentally flawed, citing concerns over alleged inducements to MPs. The integrity of how we amend our supreme law is paramount for national unity and democratic health.
6.  **Zambia's Installed Power Generation Capacity Increases**  
    The Ministry of Energy reports Zambia's installed electricity generation capacity rose to 3,871.32 MW in 2024, driven by solar projects like CEC's Kitwe expansion, with significant projects underway aiming to add 2,510 MW by 2026. This growth is essential to reduce the current 1,111 MW average deficit and alleviate the load-shedding affecting homes and businesses nationwide.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Governance & Justice:**  
    *   The State filed a cross-petition at the Constitutional Court seeking to overturn a previous ruling that required wider public consultation before constitutional amendments (Bill 7).
    *   Former Justice Minister Wynter Kabimba stated the 18-month sentence for USA-based vlogger Ethel Edwards (Chisono) for hate speech against President Hichilema underscores that democracy requires civility.
* **Sports:**  
    *   FAZ disclosed paying former Chipolopolo coach Avram Grant K6.3 million (US$277,222.99) from FIFA Forward funds for contract termination, alongside K32 million spent on various national team programs.
    *   Power Dynamos drew 1-1 with Prison Leopards in a rescheduled MTN Super League fixture at President’s Stadium in Kabwe.
    *   The Zambia Body Building Federation (ZBBF) overturned the Mr Kabwata results, nullifying Ojon Simusokwe's win and crowning Patrick Kalenga champion following public outcry and a review revealing scoring inconsistencies. *(A reminder that even our fitness forums demand fair play!)*
* **Economy & Environment:**  
    *   The Cotton Board of Zambia (CBZ) announced plans to revive cotton production, which dropped to 9,000 tonnes in 2024/25 due to pest infestations, down from 11,000 tonnes the previous season.
    *   Zambia Army Commander Lt. Gen. Geoffrey Zyeele ordered all illegal miners in the Lower Zambezi Valley to vacate immediately, declaring the activity an economic and security threat.
* **Politics:**  
    *   State House confirmed President Hichilema is reviewing a letter delivered by opposition leaders but noted the method of delivery (leaving it at the gate) hindered direct engagement.

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
1.  **Monitor Voter Registration Impact:** Observe how the ECZ's adherence to the registration deadline affects voter accessibility and potential disenfranchisement claims.
2.  **Track Constitutional Process:** Follow developments in the Constitutional Court regarding Bill 7 and the State's cross-petition, alongside the Oasis Forum's campaign urging MPs to uphold public will.
3.  **Watch Energy Project Timelines:** The timely completion of the 2,510 MW of power generation projects slated for 2025/2026 is critical for reducing load-shedding and powering economic growth.
