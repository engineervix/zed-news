Zambia faces widespread power disruptions attributed to system instability by ZESCO, while the nation mourns the deaths of two Zambia National Service personnel under suspicious circumstances. The Chipolopolo's FIFA World Cup qualification hopes ended with a decisive loss to Morocco.

## Main Stories
1.  **Reduced Power Supply Due to System Instability – Zesco**
    ZESCO attributed reduced electricity supply affecting parts of Zambia to "system instability," with some citizens receiving as little as three hours of power daily. The utility's technical teams are actively working to resolve the challenges and restore stable supply.
2.  **2 ZNS Servicemen Die at Furniture Factory**
    Two Zambia National Service servicemen died under unclear circumstances on Sunday, September 7, while on duty at the ZNS Furniture Factory in Lusaka West. Preliminary police investigations point to the possibility of foul play, and ZNS is collaborating with police to establish the circumstances.
3.  **Safety on the Road: Stage 3 Winners Take a Stand Against Drunk Driving**
    The third stage of the 1xBet Safety on the Road campaign focused on driving under the influence, engaging Zambians through discussions and challenges like the #1xBetDrinkOrDrive. Three winners received cash prizes totaling 100,000 ZMW (10,000 ZMW, 6,000 ZMW, and 4,000 ZMW) for their engagement and contributions to the conversation.
4.  **Malawi Presidential Candidates Sign Peace Declaration Ahead of Elections**
    Various aspiring Malawian presidential candidates, led by incumbent President Lazarus Chakwera, signed a Peace Declaration document in Lilongwe on Monday, committing to peaceful general elections slated for September 16, 2025. The declaration reaffirmed their dedication to elections free of violence and inequality.
5.  **Morocco Ends Zambia’s World Cup Dream**
    Morocco defeated Zambia's Chipolopolo 2-0 in a FIFA World Cup Group E qualifier at Levy Mwanawasa Stadium in Ndola, ending Zambia's qualification hopes. Goals from Youssef En-Nesyri and Igmane Hamza secured the win for Morocco, who now have 21 points in the group.
6.  **Bill 7 Will Return to Parley in Upcoming Session – Govt Whip**
    Government Chief Whip Stafford Mulusa confirmed that Bill 7 will return to Parliament in the next session opening on Friday, stating that members of parliament are excited for its return.
