A sobering start to the new year focuses national attention on road safety and the tragic human cost of accidents, while developments in governance and law enforcement underscore ongoing efforts against illicit activities.

## Main Stories
1.  **Road Safety Concerns After New Year Accidents**
    Sixteen Zambians lost their lives and dozens more were injured in 136 road traffic accidents recorded nationwide between New Year's Eve and January 2nd, 2026, highlighting the critical need for vigilance on our roads. Lusaka Province recorded the highest number of accidents (59), followed by Copperbelt (33), with police citing excessive speed as the leading cause and noting that enhanced enforcement measures contributed to a reduction compared to previous periods.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Governance & Justice:** The Drug Enforcement Commission (DEC) has summoned Lusaka Catholic Archbishop Alick Banda to explain his possession of a Toyota Hilux allegedly obtained illegally from the Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA). The DEC also reported its highest-ever seizures of illegal and controlled drugs in 2025, confiscating over 1,800 tonnes.

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
* Expect heightened police traffic patrols and enforcement, particularly in accident-prone zones like Lusaka and Copperbelt, as authorities strive to further reduce road fatalities.
* Monitor developments in the DEC's investigation concerning the vehicle linked to Archbishop Banda and the ZRA, as it progresses through official channels.
