Today’s Zambian news digest highlights a mix of economic challenges, political commentary, social issues, and sporting achievements shaping the nation’s landscape. Key themes include the urgent need for educational reforms, ongoing debates over leadership and governance, the resilience of Zambian athletes, and pressing social concerns such as domestic violence and the cost of living. As Zambia navigates these multifaceted issues, attention remains on government accountability, youth empowerment, and the country's preparations for upcoming national events.

## Main Stories

1. **Licensure Exams Long Overdue for Teachers, Journalists, and Others**
The government has been urged to address the long-standing delays in implementing licensure examinations for teachers, journalists, and other professionals. This delay hampers professional regulation and quality assurance, raising concerns about the standards of service delivery in critical sectors. Experts warn that without proper licensing, the integrity of professions could be compromised, affecting public trust and service delivery.

2. **Online Gaming Games Compared: Aviator, JetX, and Spaceman**
The rise of online crash-games like Aviator, JetX, and Spaceman has introduced new dynamics into Zambia’s entertainment and gambling sectors. Each game’s unique features—such as RTP rates, stake limits, and gameplay speed—impact player engagement and risk management. For example, Aviator’s high RTP of 97% appeals to quick-reward seekers, while JetX’s higher stakes attract serious bettors. These differences influence player choices and highlight the need for regulatory oversight in the expanding online gaming industry.

3. **High Cost of Living Increases Household Vulnerability – CSPR**
The Civil Society for Poverty Reduction (CSPR) reports that soaring living costs are making Zambian households increasingly vulnerable. Rising food, fuel, and basic service prices are placing pressure on families, especially those with limited incomes. This economic strain underscores the importance of targeted social safety nets and policy measures to cushion vulnerable populations from inflationary shocks.

4. **Vice-President Nalumango Criticized for Out-of-Touch Attitudes**
Harry Kalaba, leader of CITIZENS First, has accused Vice-President Mutale Nalumango of being disconnected from the realities faced by ordinary Zambians, suggesting she benefits from privileges that shield her from hardship. This critique reflects broader frustrations with government responsiveness amid economic hardships, including currency appreciation and fuel price reductions, which some citizens feel do not translate into tangible improvements.

5. **IK Charitable Trust Supports Education and Community Development**
In a positive development, IK Charitable Trust donated school supplies and a borehole to two schools in Chongwe and Chilanga districts. The initiative aims to support 380 pupils and demonstrates the vital role of NGOs in complementing government efforts to improve access to quality education and basic services, especially in underserved areas.

6. **Zambian Sprinter Muzala Samukonga Shows Promising Start at Prefontaine Classic**
Muzala Samukonga finished fifth in the men's 400m at the Diamond League's Prefontaine Classic, clocking a season-best 44.49 seconds. Despite not securing a podium spot, his performance signals promising progress early in the season. The high level of international competition highlights both the challenges and potential for Zambia’s athletics stars on the global stage.

7. **Domestic Violence Incident in Choma Raises Alarm**
A disturbing case emerged in Choma where a man attacked his seven-month pregnant wife with an axe and knife, sparking concerns over gender-based violence in Zambia. The victim’s separation from her husband and attack at her parents' residence underscore the urgent need for community intervention, strengthened law enforcement, and support systems for survivors.

8. **Political Criticism Over Presidential Self-Praise and Currency Claims**
Chishala Kateka of the NEW Heritage Party criticized President Hakainde Hichilema for excessive self-praise, linking it to perceived narcissism and questioning the authenticity of his claims about stabilizing the Kwacha. She argued that currency appreciation is seasonal and cautioned against over-reliance on political rhetoric, emphasizing the importance of humility and accountability in leadership.

9. **Zambia Women’s National Team Draws in WAFCON Opener**
The Copper Queens drew 2-2 against Morocco in their first match at the 2024 CAF Women’s Africa Cup of Nations. Coach Nora Häuptle praised the team’s tactical execution despite missed chances, setting a foundation for their upcoming match against Senegal—a critical game that could determine their tournament fate. The result demonstrates Zambia’s competitive spirit and potential in women’s football.

10. **Calls for Increased Funding for Electoral Commission Ahead of 2026 Elections**
Stephen Kampyongo urged the government to allocate more resources to the Electoral Commission of Zambia (ECZ), criticizing the current K342 million budget as insufficient for managing the 2026 general elections. Adequate funding is vital to ensure electoral integrity and public confidence in the democratic process, making this a pivotal issue for Zambia’s political future.
