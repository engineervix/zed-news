Zambia celebrates significant economic milestones as inflation drops to 9.4%, entering single digits for the first time since August 2023, while the IMF approves its final $190 million disbursement under the Extended Credit Facility, signaling strengthened fiscal credibility and growth projections of 5.8% for 2026.

## Main Stories
1. **Inflation Drops to Single Digits at 9.4%**  
   Zambia’s annual inflation fell to 9.4% in January 2026 from 11.2% in December 2025, driven by slower price increases in food (10.9%) and non-food items (7.3%), particularly cereals, fuel, and transport. This decline eases pressure on household budgets and moves closer to the government’s 6–8% target range.
2. **IMF Approves Final $190 Million Disbursement to Zambia**  
   The IMF completed its sixth review under the Extended Credit Facility, releasing $190 million—the final tranche of $1.7 billion in total support—citing Zambia’s "strong economic performance," fiscal consolidation, and progress in debt restructuring, which reduces public debt to 78% of GDP from 112% in 2021.
3. **President Hichilema Hails Economic Recovery Efforts**  
   President Hakainde Hichilema thanked citizens for their resilience amid economic reforms, linking declining inflation, kwacha stability, and the IMF milestone to "prudent fiscal management," while pledging to channel savings into jobs, healthcare, education, and infrastructure.
