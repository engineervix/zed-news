Today's news highlights significant strides in economic stability with the IMF programme conclusion alongside crucial energy investments, balanced against ongoing constitutional discussions and sobering reminders of the risks facing those protecting our natural heritage.

## Main Stories
1. **IMF Completes Zambia's ECF Programme, Disburses Final $190 Million**  
   The International Monetary Fund has successfully concluded its 38-month Extended Credit Facility arrangement with Zambia, releasing a final tranche of $190 million, bringing total disbursements to $1.7 billion. This marks a major endorsement of our economic reforms, projecting GDP growth of 5.2% in 2025 and 5.8% in 2026, driven by mining, agriculture, and improved electricity generation, while inflation is expected to stabilise within the 6-8% target band by 2027.

2. **UAE to Sign $270 Million Deal for 300MW Solar Plant in Chief Zingalume’s Area**  
   A high-powered UAE delegation led by Exim Bank's Massoud Hassan arrives this week to finalise an agreement with Jaja Energy and Engineering Ltd for a 300MW solar plant, with groundbreaking set for February 2026's third week and completion within 6-8 months. Located in Chief Zingalume’s area, this $270 million project, facilitated by American brokers Baker Global, promises to boost our renewable energy capacity and strengthen international investment ties.

3. **Oasis Forum Withdraws Constitutional Court Petition Challenging Bill 7 Committee**  
   The Oasis Forum, including LAZ, EFZ, and other civil bodies, has voluntarily discontinued its Constitutional Court petition against President Hichilema’s October 2025 appointment of the 25-member Technical Committee on Bill 7 amendments. Lawyer Linda Kasonde confirmed the withdrawal avoids parallel proceedings with existing cases, citing judicial economy and no prejudice to the state.

4. **Wildlife Police Officer Killed by Rhino in Lusaka, Another Survives Armed Poacher Attack in Livingstone**  
   Government mourns Wildlife Police Officer Elijah Kayaya, 28, fatally injured by a rhino during protection operations at Lusaka National Park on January 26, while a separate incident in Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park saw an officer survive an AK-47 attack by suspected poachers. Tourism Ministry spokesperson Nelly Banda condemned these organised threats to both conservation and national security.

## Other Notable Stories

  *   Jailed former Lumezi MP Munir Zulu challenges his prolonged detention at Mukobeko Maximum Security Prison, alleging unlawful 60-day remission forfeiture exceeding the legal 30-day limit under the Correctional Service Act. He seeks immediate release and damages from prison authorities.

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
