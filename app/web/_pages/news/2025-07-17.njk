Zambia’s current landscape is marked by ambitious economic visions, ongoing political debates, and a focus on regional and international sports achievements. The government remains optimistic about harnessing the country’s mineral wealth to boost growth, while challenges in healthcare, governance, and economic management continue to surface. Meanwhile, Zambia's sports teams are shining on regional stages, and cultural figures are celebrated for their contributions to national identity and democracy. These stories collectively reflect a nation striving for progress amidst complex political, economic, and social dynamics.

## Main Stories

1. **Zambia Aims to Double GDP by 2031 Through Resource Wealth**
President Hakainde Hichilema expressed unwavering confidence in Zambia’s mineral potential, emphasizing that ongoing geological mapping will unlock opportunities to double the country's GDP within the next six years. His administration is committed to responsible mining and sustainable resource management, viewing this as pivotal for economic transformation. This vision underscores Zambia’s strategic focus on leveraging its rich endowments to foster long-term growth and development, positioning the country for a significant economic leap.

2. **Clarification on Mealieb Meal Promise Highlights Political Challenges**
UPND Deputy Spokesperson Elvis Nkandu clarified that President Hichilema did not promise to reduce mealie meal to K50 during the 2021 elections but made this pledge in 2016. This distinction exposes the political sensitivities surrounding economic promises and highlights the difficulty of fulfilling public expectations amid fluctuating economic conditions. The controversy illustrates ongoing challenges for the government in managing economic promises and maintaining public trust.

3. **Healthcare Under Scrutiny: ZAMMSA Audit and Investigation**
The Zambia Medicines and Medical Supplies Agency (ZAMMSA) faces investigation by the Drug Enforcement Commission over allegations of price inflation and procurement irregularities. A forensic audit by PwC has reportedly uncovered discrepancies, though details remain confidential. This investigation signals heightened accountability efforts in Zambia’s healthcare sector, with potential implications for public health safety and trust in government institutions.

4. **Parliamentary Protocol and Personal Loss: Tasila’s Dilemma**
Patriotic Front Secretary General Raphael Nakacinda condemned the expectation for Chawama MP Tasila Lungu Mwansa to attend parliament while her father’s body remains in mourning, raising questions about balancing duty and personal grief. The incident sparks broader debate on parliamentary empathy and protocol, especially for lawmakers facing personal tragedies, reflecting the emotional complexities within Zambia's political environment.

5. **Political Negotiations and Alleged Family Case Dealings**
Former Vice President Enock Kavindele claimed that regional leaders demanded dropping legal cases against former President Edgar Lungu’s family in exchange for repatriating his remains. Lawyer Jonas Zimba disputed these claims, emphasizing transparency and integrity in negotiations. The controversy underscores concerns over political manipulation and the need for accountability in sensitive national matters.

6. **Economic Policy Debate: Over-Taxation Risks**
Opposition leader Andyford Banda warned that over-taxing small businesses through a new minimum alternative tax could hinder Zambia’s economic growth. His concerns highlight the delicate balance between raising revenue and supporting the informal sector, especially as small businesses form the backbone of the economy. This debate reflects the broader challenge of designing fiscal policies that foster growth without stifling enterprise.

7. **Legal and Political Commentary on Court Rulings and Reforms**
Legal analyst Kabesha suggested that if the court rules Bill 7 unconstitutional, it would lack clear direction, highlighting ongoing debates over judicial independence and constitutional interpretation. Meanwhile, Zambia’s women's football team, the Copper Queens, earned recognition in the WAFCON best XI, showcasing regional sporting excellence and national pride.

8. **Zambia’s International Sports and Cultural Achievements**
