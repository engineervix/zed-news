## Zambia News Digest: Tuesday, August 12, 2025

**Overview:** Today's news is dominated by urgent social crises and political maneuvering. A harrowing exposé on Lusaka's "Small Chibolya" slum underscores deep-rooted poverty and drug addiction threatening children, while the tragic shooting of a 5-year-old highlights safety concerns near foreign-run operations. Politically, the 2026 election campaign intensifies with defections, fierce rhetoric, and warnings about MPs' mental health, alongside a contentious dispute over former President Lungu's burial.

### Today's Top 8 Stories

1.  **[Matero's "Small Chibolya" Plunged into Drugs and Despair]**
    **This exposé reveals a devastating cycle of poverty, crime, and addiction trapping Lusaka's youth.** The Matero Township enclave has become a hub for marijuana trade, illicit alcohol, and lawlessness, with children as young as six involved, demanding urgent social intervention and economic alternatives beyond policing.

2.  **[5-Year-Old Girl Shot Dead Near Kasempa School; Chinese Nationals Arrested]**
    **A child's tragic death by a stray bullet near her school raises critical safety concerns around foreign-operated sites.** The arrest of two Chinese nationals for murder underscores the lethal consequences of alleged reckless firearm use near communities and schools, demanding stricter oversight of weapons in industrial/mining zones.

3.  **[ZRA Recovers K1.2 Million in Evaded Taxes from Chinese Trading Centre]**
    **This significant recovery demonstrates the government's intensified crackdown on tax evasion.** The conviction and penalty imposed on the Chinese Commercial Trading Centre serves as a strong deterrent, directly boosting national revenue and signaling commitment to combatting economic sabotage.

4.  **[Zambia and Malawi Sign Deal to Boost Agricultural Trade]**
    **A new mutual recognition agreement removes barriers for cross-border trade in maize, sorghum, and soybeans.** This pact aligns with COMESA goals, promising enhanced market access for Zambian farmers, potential price stabilization, and stronger regional economic integration.

5.  **[UPND Welcomes Potential Defection of PF's Iris Kaingu]**
    **The ruling party's openness to a former PF aspirant signals ongoing opposition fragmentation.** This potential move, met with a "good riddance" response from the PF, exemplifies the fluid political landscape and the UPND's strategy to weaken rivals ahead of 2026.

6.  **[Lungu Family Stands Firm on Burial Wishes Amid Government Pressure]**
    **The standoff over former President Lungu's burial risks inflaming political divisions.** The family's willingness to wait indefinitely for a dignified private burial in South Africa, defying the Zambian government's insistence on a state funeral, highlights deep-seated tensions and challenges to national unity.

7.  **[Hamukale Warns Unre-elected MPs Face Severe Depression Risk in 2026]**
    **Intra-party competition is predicted to cause significant mental health strain among politicians.** Former Minister Edify Hamukale's stark warning underscores the intense pressure and personal toll of Zambia's fierce political environment, overshadowing policy debates.

8.  **[Government Dismisses Harry Kalaba's Presidential Bid, Citing Debt Role]**
    **The state's outright rejection of an opposition leader questions his economic credibility.** Spokesperson Mweetwa directly links Kalaba to past debt mismanagement while dismissing his mineral resource utilization plan, framing the 2026 contest around economic stewardship.

### Other Notable Stories

* **Governance & Justice:** South Africa's DPP Shamila Batohi emphasized "zero tolerance for unethical behaviour" in prosecuting authorities, stressing the fight against white-collar crime's economic damage.
* **Traditional Leadership:** MP Brian Mundubile warned chiefs endorsing specific candidates (like Chief Machayi endorsing HH) risk backlash, urging political neutrality.
* **Sports:** Stanbic Bank renewed its K1.5 million sponsorship of NAPSA Stars FC. Despite a 2-1 loss to Angola, Chipolopolo coach Avram Grant praised the national team's improved performance.

### Key Takeaways & Watchpoints

1.  **Social Emergency:** The "Small Chibolya" report and the Kasempa child shooting demand immediate, coordinated government action on urban poverty, drug abuse, child protection, and foreign enterprise oversight. Will concrete social programs follow the exposé?
2.  **Economic Enforcement & Regionalism:** The ZRA's K1.2m tax recovery and the Malawi trade deal show active efforts to boost revenue and regional trade. Monitor impacts on commodity prices and if the tax crackdown broadens.
3.  **2026 Election Heating Up:** Defections (Kaingu), fierce personal attacks (Kalaba), warnings of MP distress, and chiefly endorsements signal a volatile campaign season. Watch for further opposition realignments and escalating rhetoric. The Lungu burial dispute remains a potential flashpoint for political tensions.
