Our nation focuses on agricultural advancement and food security today, as government targets for increased crop production highlight the critical need to address longstanding challenges with storage infrastructure, particularly for maize.

## Main Stories
1.  **Government Sets Ambitious Crop Targets Amid Storage Challenges**
    The government aims to boost maize production to 10 million tonnes annually by 2031, alongside wheat and soya bean increases, positioning Zambia as an export-oriented agricultural nation. However, this ambition faces a persistent hurdle: our current Food Reserve Agency storage capacity is only 1.2 million tonnes, significantly strained by this year's bumper maize harvest of 3.6 million tonnes, leaving a surplus of over 500,000 tonnes beyond national requirements.

## Other Notable Stories

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
* **Infrastructure Investment:** The gap between planned crop production increases and existing storage capacity necessitates urgent investment in modern, secure storage facilities nationwide to prevent post-harvest losses and maximize export potential.
* **Food Security Focus:** Effective storage management remains crucial for ensuring year-round national food security, especially after recovering from the previous season's drought-induced deficit of over two million tonnes.
