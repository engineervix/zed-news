**Zambia strides towards energy independence with a major renewable project while bracing against preventable health threats as the rainy season sets in.** Our nation's development ambitions shine through the planned 500MW solar plant on Lake Kariba, a significant boost to our power grid. Concurrently, health authorities and citizens face the familiar, critical challenge of preventing cholera outbreaks intensified by seasonal rains and sanitation issues.

## Main Stories
1.  **Siavonga Floating Solar Plant Advances with EIA Approval**
    LTI ReEnergy Cleantech has gained permission to conduct Environmental Impact Assessment studies for a proposed 500MW floating solar power plant on Lake Kariba near Banana Island, Siavonga District. This US$650-million project represents a major step in diversifying our energy mix and enhancing national power security through significant renewable investment.
2.  **Cholera Threat Looms with Rains Amid Sanitation Concerns**
    Health alerts are active in Lusaka, Chongwe, and other districts as the onset of the rainy season heightens the risk of cholera outbreaks, historically linked to blocked drains and widespread littering. The situation underscores the urgent, collective responsibility we all share in maintaining proper waste disposal to protect community health.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Energy & Environment:**
    *   Environmental and Social Impact Assessment disclosure for the Siavonga solar project was conducted last week by consulting firm Tsalach Global Limited.
* **Health & Sanitation:**
    *   Concerns are raised that accumulated garbage in townships and drainage systems creates ideal conditions for cholera transmission during the rainy season.

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
* Monitor the progress of the Siavonga solar plant's Environmental Impact Assessment, a critical step before this major energy infrastructure project can proceed.
* Heighten vigilance and adherence to sanitation best practices nationwide to combat the increased risk of cholera as the rainy season intensifies.
