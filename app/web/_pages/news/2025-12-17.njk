Zambia demonstrates regional leadership through SADC engagement while confronting critical domestic health challenges, as new research reveals alarming mental health risks among young people living with HIV and our government participates in high-level diplomatic consultations.

## Main Stories
1. **Urgent Mental Health Support Needed for HIV-Positive Youth**  
   A Zambian-led study presented in Kigali reveals nearly one-third of adolescents and young adults living with HIV in Lusaka exhibit suicidal thoughts or actions, with young women disproportionately affected at 34.3%. Mental Health Reforms Movement Coordinator Kennedy Chanda emphasizes families must provide judgment-free support and open communication to help vulnerable youth understand HIV is manageable with medication.
2. **President Hichilema Joins Crucial SADC Summit on Regional Stability**  
   President Hakainde Hichilema participates today in a virtual SADC Extraordinary Summit chaired by South Africa's President Ramaphosa, where leaders will review a fact-finding report on Madagascar's political situation. Foreign Minister Mulambo Haimbe reaffirmed Zambia's commitment to advancing peace, security, and sustainable development through SADC's established regional frameworks.
3. **Morocco's Winter Preparedness Offers Proactive Governance Insights**  
   Morocco has activated a national emergency center and provincial committees, deploying logistical resources near potentially blocked roads and securing essential supplies for 28 provinces ahead of the 2025-2026 winter season. This large-scale mobilization under royal directives demonstrates comprehensive approaches to seasonal disaster mitigation that safeguard vulnerable populations.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Health & Social Welfare:**  
  *   Mental health expert Kennedy Chanda stresses that familial acceptance and open dialogue are vital for HIV-positive youth exhibiting suicidal behaviour, noting available support systems can provide alternatives to despair.
* **Governance & Justice:**  
  *   Zambia's participation in the SADC Extraordinary Summit follows preparatory meetings by senior officials and ministers to consolidate reports for Heads of State consideration.

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
* Monitor SADC's recommendations regarding Madagascar's political situation, as Zambia's commitment to regional stability could involve diplomatic follow-up.
* Note proactive disaster management strategies globally, like Morocco's winter plan, as comparative models for our own seasonal challenges.
* Track implementation of support systems for at-risk HIV-positive youth following the alarming Lusaka study findings.
