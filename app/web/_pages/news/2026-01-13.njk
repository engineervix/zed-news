Today's news highlights developments in our justice system and a proud moment in African arts, with significant legal cases progressing and Zambian talent shining internationally. These events reflect our nation's commitment to the rule of law and cultural excellence.

## Main Stories
1. **Lusaka Banker Removed from K987,400 Theft Case Due to Illness**  
   Mildred Bupe, accused of stealing K987,400 from Atlas Mara Bank alongside two colleagues, was discharged from court proceedings by Lusaka Magistrate Idah Phiri after medical reports confirmed her prolonged illness and stroke. The trial continues for co-accused Kaseba Mulela and Mubita Songiso, underscoring our judiciary's balance between due process and compassion for health constraints in high-stakes financial crime cases.

2. **High Court Judge Recuses Herself from Zed Farmers Manslaughter Case**  
   Kabwe High Court Judge Ireen Mbewe withdrew from the trial of Maria Zaloumis (Zed Farmer), her husband, and three farm employees, citing familiarity with the Zaloumis family to preserve judicial impartiality in the death of Enoch Simfukwe. The case, involving allegations of torture at Tuzini Farms in August 2025, will be reassigned, reinforcing public confidence in our legal system's integrity during sensitive cases affecting agricultural communities.

3. **Yo Maps Wins 2025 AFRIMA Best Southern Africa Male Artist Award**  
   Zambian musician Elton "Yo Maps" Mulenga claimed the continental title in Lagos, defeating regional stars like South Africa’s Nasty C and Zimbabwe’s Jah Prayzah. His victory, celebrated with a nod to his 2.6 million Facebook supporters, elevates Zambia's creative reputation and inspires young artists across our nation—proving our cultural influence is rising. *Competition naine uzachita retire*, he quipped—a light-hearted Zed touch to a stellar achievement.
