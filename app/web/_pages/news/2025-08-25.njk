6.  **President's Son Joins ZNS for Discipline**

7.  **Muyunda Joins MultiChoice Talent Factory**  
    Lusaka-born Lilato Martina Muyunda, 22, was selected for the MultiChoice Talent Factory Academy, aiming to enhance her scriptwriting and filmmaking skills alongside pursuing an online psychology degree.
