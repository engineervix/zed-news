Prominent court cases involving political figures dominated Zambia's news cycle, alongside investigations into student deaths at UNZA and CBU. Political rhetoric intensified ahead of the 2026 elections, while authorities addressed planned power supply reductions due to maintenance.

## Main Stories
1. Court finds Nakacinda with case to answer
   The Lusaka Magistrates’ Court found PF faction Secretary General Raphael Nakacinda with a case to answer for allegedly expressing hatred based on race, tribe, place of origin, or colour. Magistrate Idah Phiri Mupemo placed Nakacinda on his defence for offences occurring between April 18 and 22, 2022, in Lusaka.

2. SA Court adjourns Lungu’s repatriation appeal indefinitely
   The South African High Court adjourned sine die the application by former president Edgar Lungu’s family for leave to appeal a judgment ordering the repatriation of his body. The adjournment followed a request by the family's lawyer, Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, citing ongoing discussions with the Zambian government.

3. Kambwili misses court due to illness
   The case against Patriotic Front member Chishimba Kambwili, charged with unlawful assembly, failed to proceed as Kambwili was reported unwell. He faces allegations of assembling with intent to commit an offence or breach peace in Lusaka on January 26, 2023.

4. Court reallocates Binwell’s sedition case
   Lusaka Magistrate’s Court reallocated Nkana MP Binwell Mpundu's sedition case to Magistrate Webster Milumbe. Mpundu is charged for allegedly publishing seditious words via a social media post on December 20, 2024, in Lusaka.

5. Police confirm suicide of UNZA medical student
   Lusaka Police confirmed the death of 22-year-old UNZA Ridgeway Campus medical student Abel Nsapato, whose semi-decomposed body was found near Sun City Hotel on August 17. An empty pesticide bottle was found near his body; he had been missing since August 9.

6. Don’t panic over 5 hour power availability due to Maamba maintenance – Ncube
   ZESCO Board Chairperson Vickson Ncube urged citizens not to panic over Maamba Energy's 30-day bi-annual maintenance on its 300MW coal-fired power plant, which triggered stage 10 load management. Ncube stated this routine maintenance occurs annually around the same period.

7. Its madness to say Zambia has become poorer under UPND – Govt
   Chief Government Spokesperson Cornelius Mweetwa dismissed claims that Zambia has become poorer under the UPND, citing a projected six percent economic growth for the year. Mweetwa challenged critics to provide statistics, noting Zambia is rated among Africa's best-performing economies.

8. CBU student found dead in trunk, police say
   Copperbelt Police identified human remains found in a trunk on the Ndola-Kitwe dual carriageway as Fred Kapuku, a 34-year-old CBU medical student. Kapuku was last seen driving a black Toyota Mark X (BCG 7441) on August 16; his head and lower limbs were found separately in Ndola.
