Our nation navigates a day of significant developments across energy, youth empowerment, and governance, showcasing efforts to bolster economic resilience and safeguard citizens' well-being amidst ongoing challenges. Key themes include proactive steps to mitigate load shedding impacts, advancements in public health, and investments in our future leaders, all underpinned by crucial economic indicators.

## Main Stories
1.  **Government Prioritizes Electricity for Vulnerable Communities Amid Load Shedding**
    President Hakainde Hichilema has directed Zesco to guarantee 10-15 hours of daily electricity for vulnerable households and small businesses in 21 compounds, specifically targeting salons, barbershops, welders, and perishable goods traders to protect livelihoods and reduce economic vulnerability during the power crisis.
2.  **Youth Summit Ignites National Potential with Major Private Sector Backing**
    Yango Zambia's sponsorship of the BeRelevant Youth Summit 2025 facilitated a dynamic platform in Lusaka for over 800 young leaders, government officials, and innovators, focusing on leadership and entrepreneurship, with initiatives expected to positively influence an estimated 50,000 Zambians through youth-led community projects.
3.  **Contraception Use Reaches 52% Among Married Women, Funding Increases**
    Zambia's modern contraceptive prevalence rate among married women has risen to 52%, with the Ministry of Health increasing domestic funding for reproductive health commodities to $4.5 million in 2025, a 67% rise from 2023, marking significant progress in family planning access and health investment.
4.  **NPA Dismisses Prosecutors Failing Mandatory Degree Requirement**
    The National Prosecutions Authority has dismissed over 40 prosecutors for failing to obtain a Bachelor of Laws degree within the agreed timeframe, upholding professional standards required by the NPA Act to ensure prosecutorial functions are handled by qualified legal professionals.
5.  **CTPD Advocates for Increased Health Funding Following US Aid Withdrawal**
    The Center for Trade Policy and Development (CTPD) has urged the government to significantly increase the health sector's budgetary allocation and explore higher taxes on tobacco, alcohol, and sugary beverages to build resilience after the withdrawal of US aid, stressing the need for sustainable domestic financing.
