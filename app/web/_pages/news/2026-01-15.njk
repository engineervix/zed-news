**Zambia witnesses a historic demonstration of peaceful democracy in Chawama today, while economic measures concerning currency transition and farmer payments progress, underscoring both national unity and practical governance efforts.**

## Main Stories
1.  **Peaceful Chawama By-election Marks Democratic Maturity**
    Residents flocked peacefully to polling stations in Chawama constituency today to elect a new Member of Parliament, a stark contrast to previous violent elections there, with Returning Officer Lewis Lupando and Zambia Centre for Inter-party Dialogue's Doreen Kabwe commending the campaigns' tolerance and predicting a peaceful outcome, strengthening our democratic credentials.
2.  **Old Banknotes to Expire April 1, 2026; Exchange Urged**
    The Bank of Zambia has reminded citizens that old banknotes will cease to be legal tender on April 1, 2026, and will no longer be valid for transactions or exchange, advising the public to exchange them at any commercial bank or NATSAVE branch nationwide by March 31, 2026, ensuring a smooth transition to the new currency series launched last year.
3.  **Maize Payment Funds Reaching Farmers, System Review Underway**
    State House confirms funds released to pay farmers for maize supplied to the Food Reserve Agency (FRA) are reaching beneficiaries nationwide, acknowledging processing delays due to the unexpectedly large "historic bumper harvest," while the government develops a more sustainable crop marketing framework beyond the FRA's original strategic reserve mandate.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Governance & Justice:**
    *   Former Ministry of Agriculture secretary Meya Masumba-Miti (55) and two herbalists, Florence Banda (43) and Yamikani Banda (50), pleaded not guilty in Lusaka High Court to the alleged murder of Francisco Miti, a director at the Seed Control and Certification Institute, on August 24, 2024; trial begins next week.
* **By-Election Details:**
    *   Nine male candidates are contesting the Chawama parliamentary by-election, triggered by the prolonged absence of former MP Tasila Lungu following her father's death, with the ruling UPND represented by Morgan Muunda and FDD by Bright Nundwe.

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
* Monitor the official results of the Chawama by-election as a barometer of our maturing democratic peace and its potential influence on campaigning for the August 2026 general elections.
* Ensure all old banknotes are exchanged at banks or NATSAVE branches before the March 31, 2026 deadline to avoid financial loss.
* Track the government's progress in implementing the new, more efficient crop marketing framework promised to better handle future bumper harvests.
