Zambia today reflects on national resilience through sporting introspection, anticipates future governance direction with new polling data, addresses critical agricultural payments, and confronts public safety concerns through high-profile legal proceedings.

## Main Stories
1.  **President Hichilema Calls for Sports Revolution Post-AFCON Exit**
    Following the Chipolopolo's exit from the AFCON tournament in Morocco, President Hichilema expressed solidarity with the team, framing defeat as a catalyst for reassessment and rebuilding Zambia's proud sporting heritage, specifically highlighting the critical loss of grassroots infrastructure in schools and local authorities due to past malpractices.
2.  **Opinion Poll Shows Strong Lead for President Hichilema in 2026 Scenario**
    A comprehensive national poll supervised by Dr. Namuunda Mutombo of the University of Zambia, interviewing 1,009 adults across all provinces between October 2nd-15th, 2025, indicates President Hichilema would secure between 58% and 63% of the vote if elections were held today, reflecting rising optimism with nearly two-thirds of Zambians agreeing the nation is "slowly turning a corner".
3.  **Government Guarantees Full FRA Maize Payments to Farmers by January 10**
    Finance Minister Situmbeko Musokotwane assured all farmers who supplied maize to the Food Reserve Agency that outstanding payments will be settled by January 10, 2026, acknowledging the delay is regrettable but confirming rolling payments will continue using funds from financing institutions and maize sales, recognizing these funds are vital for households, livelihoods, and preparing for the current farming season.
4.  **Eight Accused, Including Minor, Committed for Trial in Fuel Attendant Murder**
    A 15-year-old Grade 7 pupil and seven men have been committed to the High Court for trial in connection with the July murder of fuel attendant Sibeso Akaliwa and the violent attack on Mapalo Mwelwa at a Rubis station in Lusaka's Hellen Kaunda area; they face charges of murder, attempted murder, and aggravated robbery involving weapons and theft.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Governance & Justice:** Eight individuals, including a 15-year-old boy, Marriot Lungu (22), Boniface Mwanza (23), Moses Zulu (21), Given Banda (28), Rabson Lungu (32), Clifford Musanda (30), and Peter Daka (18), were committed to the Lusaka High Court by Magistrate Idah Phiri for trial on charges related to the murder of Sibeso Akaliwa and attack on Mapalo Mwelwa at a Rubis service station in July.
