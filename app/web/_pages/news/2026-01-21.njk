Zambia navigates economic complexities today with agricultural market fluctuations alongside promising mining sector forecasts, while judicial rulings and educational milestones shape our national development landscape.

## Main Stories
1. **Tomato Glut Crushes Farmers' Profits**  
   An oversupply at Lusaka's Soweto Market has plunged tomato prices to K100 per box, from previous highs of K800, causing significant losses for small-scale farmers. Zambia Fruits and Vegetable Association attributes this to a 'herd mentality' among farmers who expanded production after last season-highs, warning this may trigger future shortages as discouraged growers abandon the crop.
2. **World Bank Predicts 4.3% Growth for Zambia**  
   The World Bank's Global Economic Prospects Report forecasts Zambia's economy growing at 4.3% in 2026 and 4.5% in 2027, driven by rising mining investment and copper production. This positions our nation among top-performing industrial commodity exporters, strengthening export earnings and revenue critical for national development.
3.3. **Army Enforces Order in Mufumbwe Gold Fields**  
   Licensed artisanal miners in Mufumbwe District welcome the Zambia Army's order for illegal miners to vacate Kikonge and Deng and Dengwe sites by next week, citing disruptions to legal operations and local insecurity. Miners like Caleb Likomeno report illegal occupation has prevented land allocation to cooperatives, threatening orderly economic benefits from our gold resources.

## Other Notable Stories

    *   Constitutional Court dismissed Tresford Chali's petition challenging the Judicial Complaints Commission's report recommending removal of three judges, ruling it lacked jurisdiction and should have been filed as a judicial review in the High Court.
    *   Psychiatrist Dr Naeem Dalal testified in the John General rape trial that married women suffer more severe mental health impacts from sexual abuse due to cultural expectations, describing victims' common trauma responses like tonic immobility.
*obility.
* **Education Milestone:**  
    *   Grade 12 pass rates reached a historic 70.27% (136,434 candidates), attributed to 4 years of government policies including free education, teacher recruitment, and infrastructure improvements like desk procurement and classroom construction.
* **Economy & Revenue:**  
    *   Zambia Revenue Authority recovered K10.7 million from United Chemicals Zambia Limited after its conviction for submitting falsified VAT returns claiming K19.1 million in zero-rated exports to DR Congo, resulting in a K40,000 fine and K400,000 costs compensation.
* **Culture/Tradition:**  
    *   Abasano ba Mfumu, wife of Paramount Chief Chitimukulu of the Bemba people, died in a road accident, with government joining the Royal Family in mourning her loss as a pillar of family and social stability.

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
* Monitor tomato supply chains closely over the next two months as reduced planting could trigger shortages, impacting both farmer incomes and consumer prices.
* Track progress on new mining investments and copper production levels, vital for achieving the World Bank's 2026-2027 growth projections for our economy.
* Sustain focus on educational infrastructure and teacher support to maintain the momentum behind the record 70.27% Grade 12 pass rate.
