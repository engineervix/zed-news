Our nation sees pivotal developments today, from landmark economic agreements and ambitious revenue targets to spirited debates on national policy and commendable strides in continental football that unite us in pride. Key discussions on governance, resource management, and social equity remain at the forefront as Zambia continues its growth trajectory.

## Main Stories
1. **TAZARA Secures $1.4 Billion Revitalization Deal**  
   Zambia, Tanzania, and China signed a landmark agreement to upgrade the Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA), including track maintenance and new locomotives/coaches/wagons. This critical infrastructure project promises enhanced regional trade connectivity and economic opportunities for Zambians.

2. **ZRA Targets K185 Billion Revenue in 2026**  
   Zambia Revenue Authority Director General Dingani Banda announced a K185 billion collection target (20% of projected GDP), with VAT as the largest contributor at K54.4 billion. This revenue is vital for funding national development programs and public services.

3. **Power Dynamos Advance in CAF Champions League**  
   Power Dynamos progressed to the CAF Champions League final preliminary round after defeating ASEC Mimosas in a penalty shootout, with Lawrence Mulenga’s decisive save. They will face Uganda’s Vipers FC in October, representing Zambia’s football excellence on the continental stage.

4. **2026 Budget Debate Centers on Worker Concerns**  
   Zambia Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) President Blake Mulala criticized the unchanged PAYE threshold, stating it strains workers, while NGOCC highlighted the absence of menstrual poverty funding. These critiques underscore budget priorities impacting household finances and social welfare.

5. **Government Confident in 3 Million Tonne Copper Goal**  
   President Hichilema affirmed Zambia’s target of producing 3 million tonnes of copper annually by 2031, citing projects like Ming’omba Mine as key drivers. Achieving this is crucial for foreign exchange earnings and national economic transformation.

## Other Notable Stories
**Governance & Justice:**  
* Livingstone Mayor Constance Muleabai testified in court, denying corruption allegations involving K180,000 in property rate cancellations, claiming the case aims to tarnish her reputation. Judgement is set for November 28, 2025.  
* Lusaka High Court granted former Kasama MP Kelvin Sampa K250,000 bail pending appeal against his two-year theft conviction.  

**Politics & Diplomacy:**  
* Chief Nyakaseya of Ikelenge District urged the UPND to govern alone, alleging alliance partners like Enoch Kavindele and Nevers Mumba mislead the President and cause division.  
* President Hichilema departed for a UK working visit at King Charles III's invitation, aiming to promote Zambian investment opportunities and strengthen bilateral ties.  
* Luapula Minister Nason Musonda praised President Hichilema for rescuing Zambia from "economic ICU," contrasting past PF governance in the province.  

**Economic Policy:**  
* Finance Minister Situmbeko Musokotwane pledged to maintain fiscal discipline through the 2026 election period, emphasizing this as a hallmark of the New Dawn administration.  
* ZIPAR described the 2026 Budget as a "fair outlay" enabling inclusive growth, notably welcoming funding for the new Mineral Regulation Commission.  

**Social Development:**  
* NGOCC Executive Director Anne Anamela expressed disappointment over zero budget allocation to combat menstrual poverty.  

**Local Incidents:**  
* Kabanana mechanic Richard Mpolokoso, drunk and unlicensed, crashed a customer’s Mercedes-Benz at Addis Ababa Roundabout. Both he and the vehicle owner face charges.  

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
1.   Monitor the implementation timeline and economic impact of the $1.4 billion TAZARA revitalization project on regional trade corridors.  
2.   Track progress toward Zambia's ambitious copper production target of 3 million tonnes annually by 2031, a key economic pillar.  
3.   Observe parliamentary and public discourse on the 2026 Budget's social provisions, particularly regarding the PAYE threshold and menstrual poverty funding.
