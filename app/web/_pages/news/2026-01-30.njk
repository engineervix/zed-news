**Today's digest reflects our collective spirit in action – from citizens driving healthcare improvements through grassroots initiatives to matters of national unity requiring thoughtful resolution. Both stories remind us that progress happens when Zambians work together towards common goals.**

## Main Stories
1.  **Lusaka Fitness Squad Donates K63,015 to National Heart Hospital for Children:** Zambia's largest amateur running club presented this significant donation, raised through member and public contributions, specifically to enhance child-friendly facilities at the National Heart Hospital. The funds will create play areas and provide learning resources, ensuring young patients battling congenital heart disease receive care in a more comforting environment, inspired by Dr. Donald Mumba's 56km run and the club's ongoing commitment to community health.
2.  **Government Aims for Pre-Election Burial of Former President Lungu:** Attorney General Mulilo Kabesha stated the government's hope that the late sixth President, Edgar Chagwa Lungu, will be laid to rest before the August 13 general elections. This depends on the outcome of an ongoing legal process in South Africa, where the Lungu family has until February 11, 2026, to file an appeal against a High Court decision granting the Zambian government permission to repatriate his remains for burial, following a dispute over his final resting place and burial arrangements.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Health & Community:**
    *   Dr. Donald Mumba, President of the Zambia Pediatric Association and Lusaka Fitness Squad member, highlighted that congenital heart disease affects about one in every hundred Zambian children, motivating the club's hospital support initiative.
    *   Senior Medical Superintendent Dr. Shumba commended the Lusaka Fitness Squad, emphasizing that their donation represents collaboration, care, and dedication beyond running, significantly impacting children and families.
* **Governance & Justice:**
    *   The legal dispute over former President Lungu's burial involves a South African Supreme Court of Appeal decision (December 23, 2025) granting the family leave to appeal the High Court ruling that allowed repatriation to Zambia.

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
* The National Heart Hospital will soon begin implementing child-friendly facility upgrades funded by the Lusaka Fitness Squad donation, directly improving the experience for young cardiac patients.
* The February 11, 2026, deadline for the Lungu family to file their appeal notice in South Africa is the next critical step determining the timeline for resolving the former President's burial.
* Continued community initiatives like the Lusaka Fitness Squad's demonstrate the tangible impact Zambians can have on improving national healthcare resources through organized effort.
