Today’s headlines highlight ongoing challenges in Zambia’s energy sector, the evolving political landscape, vibrant developments in sports, and critical issues surrounding governance and justice. The country faces power supply constraints, political debates over constitutional reforms, and significant strides in both men’s and women’s football, reflecting a nation balancing development, political accountability, and social progress.

## Main Stories
1. **Zesco Increases Load Shedding as Maamba Generator Shutdown Deepens Power Crisis**
ZESCO has announced an extension of load shedding hours from 7 to 5 daily for residential customers, following the shutdown of the Maamba Energy Limited generator, which supplies 150 MW. This reduction underscores Zambia’s ongoing energy infrastructure vulnerabilities and the urgent need for diversified power sources. The power outage has prompted a stage 10 load management response, affecting households and businesses nationwide, and emphasizes the importance of resilient energy planning.

2. **President Hakainde Hichilema Criticizes Political Double Standards on Constitutional Amendments**
President HH has voiced concern over what he perceives as inconsistency in the political critique of his government’s constitutional reforms, noting that past administrations—including UNIP, MMD, and PF—also amended the constitution without similar scrutiny. His comments highlight the politicization of constitutional change amid an election year and reflect broader tensions around governance, political perception, and the handling of national reforms. HH also touched on his respectful stance during the funeral of former President Edgar Lungu, illustrating the complex interplay between politics and social protocol.

3. **Legal and Media Freedom Tensions Surface in Court and Press Cases**
The Lusaka High Court will hear a case involving News Diggers Media Limited challenging an injunction by the Chinese Chamber of Commerce over a documentary, raising important questions about press freedom and the limits of defamation laws. Concurrently, a court adjournment was granted to Socialist Party leader Fred M'membe to attend Edgar Lungu’s funeral in South Africa, illustrating the intersection of politics, justice, and public sentiment in Zambia’s legal landscape.

4. **Environmental and Social Justice: Farmers to Receive Extended Compensation for Pollution Damage**
The government announced an upgrade to a compensation package for farmers affected by pollution from Sino-Metals, extending support from one to three years. This move signals a strengthening of environmental accountability and underscores government efforts to address social grievances, particularly as President HH visits affected regions. The initiative complements other developmental projects like the commissioning of the Chilanga Cement plant, reflecting a focus on sustainable growth.

5. **Security Measures to Combat Illegal Mining and Boost Football Development**
Zambia’s government plans to deploy defense personnel to curb illegal mining activities, which threaten the country's resources and safety. Meanwhile, in sports, Power Dynamos and Mufulira Wanderers are preparing for upcoming seasons, with the latter appointing Lameck Banda as head coach in a bid to end a 29-year league drought. These moves highlight efforts to stabilize and elevate Zambia’s sporting and economic sectors.

6. **Zambia’s Women’s Football Gains Momentum at WAFCON 2025**
Captain Barbra Banda is set to debut at the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco, leading the Copper Queens in their opening match against hosts Morocco. With high hopes of winning the tournament—an achievement that would mark a historic milestone—her leadership exemplifies Zambia’s rising prominence in African women’s football. The tournament is broadcast by MultiChoice Zambia through SuperSport, showcasing African talent and inspiring future generations.

7. **Political and Legal Developments Surrounding Edgar Lungu’s Legacy**
The Lusaka High Court has adjourned a case involving Fred M'membe, who is also attending Lungu’s funeral, amid discussions about the former president’s burial. The government, through the Attorney General, insists Lungu should be repatriated and buried in Zambia, emphasizing the importance of national legacy and cultural respect. Archbishop Alick Banda praised Lungu as a “people’s president,” highlighting his humility and dedication, which bolsters his posthumous reputation amidst political sensitivities.
