Zambia's economic trajectory continues to show significant positive momentum, highlighted by major strides in debt resolution and creditworthiness, while national pride focuses on preparations for the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations.

## Main Stories

    Reflecting on the critical economic situation inherited in 2021, characterised by unsustainable borrowing and a massive debt mountain, President Hakainde Hichilema noted that approximately 94% of eligible external debt is now restructured, marking a crucial step towards stability. This progress, confirmed by international partners and evidenced by Standard & Poor's upgrading Zambia's credit rating from Selective Default to CCC+/C, signifies the nation's shift from a high-risk investment case to a more attractive destination, fostering a resurgence in business activity crucial for job creation and national prosperity.

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
