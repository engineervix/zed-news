As our nation navigates energy challenges, political discourse intensifies ahead of 2026 elections, and Zambian excellence shines internationally, today’s developments underscore our collective resilience and aspirations for progress.

## Main Stories
1. **Energy Minister Projects Major Load-Shedding Reduction by December**  
   Minister Makozo Chikote confirmed Zambia’s power deficit stands at 1,555 megawatts but assured that 425 megawatts of new capacity will be added by December 2025, significantly improving supply. High-density townships in 21 areas now receive at least 10 hours of electricity daily, with plans to expand coverage as generation increases—a critical relief for households and small businesses nationwide.
2. **Pharmaceutical Society Demands K10 Billion for Essential Medicines**  
   The Pharmaceutical Society of Zambia urges the government to double the medicines budget to K10 billion in the 2026 national budget, up from K4.9 billion, to offset withdrawn donor aid and reduce dependency. This increase is vital to safeguard public health services and ensure consistent access to life-saving drugs across our communities.
3. **Opposition Unity Declared Essential for 2026 Election Success**  
   United Kwacha Alliance chairperson Sakwiba Sikota warned that opposition parties acting alone in next year’s elections will fail, emphasizing that Zambians demand collaborative leadership. This call reflects broader public sentiment for cohesive governance alternatives amid ongoing political realignments.
4. **Government Defends Parliamentary Impartiality Amid Bias Claims**  
   Deputy Chief Whip Likando Mufalali countered accusations of parliamentary bias by Catholic Priest Fr. Augustine Mwewa, stating punishments stem solely from breaches of Standing Orders. This debate touches on the integrity of our legislative institutions as they handle increasingly contentious debates.
5. **Barbra Banda Ranked 14th in Global Women’s Football Awards**  
   Copper Queens Captain Barbra Banda secured 14th place in the 2025 Women’s Ballon d’Or—Africa’s second-highest ranking—reinforcing Zambia’s growing influence in international sports and inspiring young athletes across our nation.
