Zambia reaffirms its commitment to reproductive health funding with significant financial allocations, while sports headlines feature national team selections and disciplinary actions in football leagues. Concurrently, economic debates surface regarding fiscal ratings, and developments unfold in high-profile legal cases involving taxation and alleged murder.

## Main Stories
1.  **Zambia Disburses $11.4 Million for Reproductive Health Commodities**
    The government has disbursed over USD 11.4 million from the national treasury since signing a February 2023 Memorandum of Understanding with UNFPA to boost local funding for sexual and reproductive health commodities. This includes USD 4.3 million allocated for procurement in 2025 through the UNFPA system.
2.  **Hazel Nali Returns in ZESCO Ndola Girls Squad for CAF Qualifiers**
    Copper Queens goalkeeper Hazel Nali has been named in ZESCO Ndola Girls' 25-member squad for the 2025 CAF Women’s Champions League COSAFA Qualifiers in South Africa after recovering from a year-long injury. She will compete for the starting position with Annie Namonje and Leticia Lungu.
3.  **ZPL Sanctions Zesco United for Fielding Ineligible Players**
    Zesco United has been sanctioned by the Zambian Premier League with a 3-0 forfeiture loss to Konkola Blades and a K10,000 fine for fielding ineligible players during their August 16, 2025 match at Levy Mwanawasa Stadium. The sanction references breaches of the FAZ Disciplinary Code.
4.  **Police Confirm Four Suspects in Enock Simfukwe's Killing**
    Police in Central Province have confirmed four people are in connection with the death of 22-year-old Enock Simfukwe, who died on August 17 from blunt force trauma and head injuries. Simfukwe was buried at Lusaka’s Chingwere Cemetery on August 21, 2025.
5.  **Supreme Court Orders Nestlé Zambia to Pay K13.8 Million in Taxes**
    The Supreme Court ruled in favour of ZRA, ordering Nestlé Zambia to pay K13.8 million in taxes following a transfer pricing audit covering 2010-2014. The ruling overturns a previous Tax Appeals Tribunal decision that had favoured Nestlé on five out of six grounds.
6.  **President Hichilema Appoints New Deputy Air Force Commander**
    President Hakainde Hichilema has appointed Brigadier General Henry Chiwaya as the new Deputy Air Force Commander, promoting him to Major General. This follows the redeployment of outgoing Deputy Commander Major General Arthur Kalaluka into the diplomatic service.
