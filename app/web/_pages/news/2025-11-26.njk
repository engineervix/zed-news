Today's developments highlight pivotal moments in our constitutional processes, underscore persistent challenges in sports funding affecting our national representation, and reveal significant strides in voter registration efforts across Southern Province.

## Main Stories
1. Netball Teams Withdraw from 2025 Africa Cup  
   Zambia's men's and women's netball teams withdrew from the 2025 Africa Netball Cup due to an inability to raise K1,200,000 for participation, marking another setback for our athletes' continental visibility after similar past withdrawals.
2. ConCourt Rejects Bid to Halt Constitution Amendments  
   The Constitutional Court dismissed LAZ and civil society groups' application to suspend the Technical Committee on Constitution amendments, prioritizing public interest in allowing the committee's work on Constitutional Amendment Bill No. 7 to proceed.
3. Voter Registration Discrepancy in Southern Province  
   Southern Province Minister Credo Nanjuwa reported over 430,000 new voter registrations and updates, surpassing the 420,001 target, despite ECZ statistics showing only 143,000, citing delays in the commission's record-keeping as the cause.

## Other Notable Stories
**Governance & Justice:**  
* Kelvin Fube Bwalya criticized Home Affairs Minister Jack Mwiimbu for labeling protests against Constitutional Amendment Bill No. 7 "counterproductive," recalling Mwiimbu's prior support for anti-Bill 10 demonstrations.  
* Former minister Dora Siliya urged the PF to postpone leadership succession talks until after Edgar Lungu's burial and called on government to address power shortages and high living costs as citizen priorities.  

**Sports:**  
* Cricket coach Isaac Mwaba unveiled Zambia’s 15-member squad for December’s West Africa Trophy in Nigeria, featuring a blend of experienced and emerging talent against Sierra Leone, Rwanda, and the hosts.  
* Copper Queens bolstered their defense with Turkey-based players Lushomo Mweemba and Martha Tembo joining camp for the FIFA Window Malawi tournament, increasing foreign-based squad members to four.  

**Corporate Citizenship:**  
* Trade Kings launched its "Be A Community Hero" hygiene campaign amid cholera concerns, donating mealie meal, Banja detergent, chlorine, and other supplies to Our Lady’s Hospice in Kalingalinga.  

**Regional Developments:**  
* Tanzania canceled its December 9 independence celebrations to redirect funds toward rebuilding infrastructure damaged during post-election unrest, amid opposition calls for protests over disputed polls.  

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
* **Sports Funding Review:** The netball withdrawal necessitates urgent dialogue between sports bodies, government, and private partners to secure consistent support for national teams.
* **Constitutional Process Vigilance:** Continued scrutiny of the Technical Committee’s amendments is vital to ensure alignment with public interests.
* **Voter Roll Verification:** Reconciliation of Southern Province’s reported registrations with ECZ data is critical for electoral transparency ahead of future polls.
