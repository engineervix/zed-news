Here is today's Zambian news digest, highlighting developments shaping our nation's progress and unity:

Our nation focuses on strengthening economic foundations through practical fiscal policies, reinforcing constitutional governance principles, and drawing lessons from our beloved Chipolopolo's AFCON journey. Meanwhile, local democracy remains active with by-elections, and corporate initiatives celebrate Zambian spirit.

## Main Stories
1.  **Government Clarifies Mining Tax Payments in Yuan**
    Finance Minister Situmbeko Musokotwane confirmed that requiring some mining companies to pay taxes partially in Chinese Yuan aims to reduce currency conversion costs when settling Zambia's bilateral obligations with China, with this year's mineral tax breakdown set at 60% US Dollar, 25% Kwacha Zambian, and 15% Yuan.
2.  **Government Reaffirms Presidential Immunity as Sole Constitutional Exception**
    Information Minister Cornelius Mweetwa emphasized in Choma that Zambia's Constitution grants immunity from prosecution solely to the sitting President during tenure, firmly stating the rule of law applies equally to all other citizens regardless of status, reinforcing our commitment to legal equality.
3.  **Former Coach Micho Analyses Chipolopolo AFCON Exit**
    Milutin 'Micho' Sredojevic attributed the Chipolopolo's early elimination from AFCON partly to the choice of playing destinations for many Zambian players impacting performance, urging the team to learn lessons and prepare thoroughly for the next qualifiers to ensure stronger future tournament showings.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Politics:**
    *   Campaigning intensifies for the Chawama parliamentary by-election with nine candidates confirmed, including representatives from FDD (supported by Tonse Alliance), NDC, NCP, EPPP, Leadership Movement, Citizens First, and an independent candidate.
* **Business & Innovation:**
    *   Yango Zambia hosted a unique AFCON bus tour and watch party experience in Lusaka for competition winners, featuring a city tour with a live DJ, interactive games, and a special appearance by musician Yo Maps, aiming to deepen user engagement through memorable local experiences.

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
* Monitor the implementation and impact of the multi-currency mineral tax policy (USD, ZMW, Yuan) on foreign exchange reserves and bilateral debt servicing efficiency.
* Focus shifts to the Chipolopolo's rebuilding and preparation strategy following AFCON exit, as advised by former coach Micho, ahead of upcoming qualifiers.
* Observe the outcome of the Chawama by-election as a barometer of local political engagement and representation.
