**A day marked by strengthened governance at our borders, national pride on the football pitch, and the judicial system affirming due process underscores our nation's ongoing journey.** These events touch upon citizen rights, international representation, and the rule of law.

## Main Stories

    The Zambia Revenue Authority is investigating reports that a Zambian national based in South Africa was denied entry with her vehicle at Kazungula One Stop Border Post, following the circulation of her ordeal on social media; this probe reaffirms the Authority's commitment to facilitating legitimate trade and upholding its core values of integrity and professionalism while serving citizens and visitors. ZRA Corporate Communications Manager Oliver Nzala also reminded travelers entering with private vehicles to present required documents like passports, vehicle registration certificates, Interpol clearance, proof of ownership, and valid Zambian motor insurance.
2.  **Patson Daka Credits Faith for Resilience Amidst Criticism**
