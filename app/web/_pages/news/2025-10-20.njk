Our nation progresses on multiple fronts today, with significant developments aimed at strengthening our economy, protecting our environment, and shaping our constitutional future. Key themes include enhancing revenue collection through better tax education, driving regional connectivity for growth, safeguarding vital water resources, and advancing the crucial national dialogue on our constitution.

## Main Stories
1.  **Call for Enhanced Tax Education Targets Informal Sector & Schools**
    Economist Kampamba Shula has urged the Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) to significantly improve tax education within our large informal sector to boost compliance and revenue collection, while also recommending its inclusion in the national school curriculum to build future tax literacy.
2.  **Minister Tayali Champions Multimodal Connectivity for African Transformation**
    Transport and Logistics Minister Frank Tayali, speaking at the Angola Transport Summit, emphasized that integrating road, rail, air, maritime, and pipeline networks is fundamental to Africa's sustainable economic growth and regional integration, positioning Zambia as an advocate for continental progress.
3.  **ZEMA Directs Urgent Pollution Controls at Sino Metals Before Rains**
    The Zambia Environmental Management Agency (ZEMA) has mandated Sino Metals Leach Zambia Limited to construct critical environmental safeguards – including a catch drain and at least four silt traps – before the rainy season to prevent further contamination of the Kafue River, protecting this essential water source for countless Zambians.
4.  **Constitution Review Technical Committee Receives Public Guidelines**
    The Government has finalized and handed over the Terms of Reference (ToRs) for the constitutional review process to the newly appointed Technical Committee, with Secretary to the Cabinet Patrick Kangwa confirming these guidelines will be published in newspapers and online for public access, marking a vital step in our national constitutional journey.
5.  **President Hichilema Stresses Character Reformation for Child Defilers**
    President Hakainde Hichilema, represented by Justice Minister Princess Kasune, stated that merely increasing custodial sentences for child defilers is insufficient, calling for genuine repentance and character reformation, urging the Church to play a key role in guiding perpetrators towards true change to protect our children.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Governance & Justice:**
    *   A Livingstone-based police officer, accused of swindling members of the public out of thousands of Kwacha (up to K11,000 per person) by falsely promising jobs and release of relatives from custody, was arrested in Maramba Township after months in hiding.
* **Faith & Community:**
    *   President Hichilema commended the Anglican Church for its immense contributions to Zambia's education and health sectors, particularly in underserved areas, during the enthronement ceremony of Bishop Emmanuel Chikoya as the fifth Bishop of the Diocese of Central Zambia in Ndola, represented by Minister Frank Tayali. A true display of faith in action for our nation's wellbeing.

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
* Monitor ZRA's response to calls for enhanced tax education in the informal sector and schools.
* Watch for Sino Metals' implementation of ZEMA's pollution control directives ahead of the rainy season.
* Engage with the published Terms of Reference for the constitutional review process to understand the framework guiding this critical national exercise.
