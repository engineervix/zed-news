## Overview
Wednesday, August 13th, 2025, featured significant developments across Zambia’s political, economic, and social spheres. Key themes included legal proceedings linked to former President Edgar Lungu’s burial, opposition party transitions, major economic announcements, and social initiatives addressing child welfare and public health. Monetary policy remained steady amid inflation concerns, while agricultural exports signaled robust harvests.

## Today’s Top 8 Stories
1. Lungu burial appeal set for Friday  
   <br>  
   **Why this matters:** The legal dispute over former President Edgar Lungu’s burial could influence Zambia-South Africa relations and presidential legacy protocols. The family’s appeal against a South African High Court judgment will be heard this Friday, highlighting unresolved tensions.

2. PF to select new leader via convention  
   <br>  
   **Why this matters:** The Patriotic Front’s upcoming leadership convention will determine its presidential candidate for the Tonse Alliance. Party spokesperson Mundubile confirmed the process follows constitutional guidelines, shaping opposition strategy against the UPND government.

3. Cabinet approves 500,000+ MT maize export  
   <br>  
   **Why this matters:** This authorization leverages Zambia’s surplus to boost regional food security and agricultural liquidity. The move supports the government’s target of 10 million metric tonnes of maize production while generating foreign exchange.

4. Govt receives K91m ZCCM-IH dividend  
   <br>  
   **Why this matters:** The payout reflects ZCCM-IH’s recovery from a K47 billion 2023 loss to a K40 billion 2024 profit. This turnaround aids Zambia’s economy, especially after resolving Mopani Copper Mines’ US$1.7 billion debt burden.

5. K250m drug rehab centre underway  
   <br>  
   **Why this matters:** The national facility addresses Zambia’s drug addiction crisis through a public-health approach. Vice-President Mutale Nalumango emphasized treating addiction as a chronic disease, aiming to mitigate social and economic impacts.

6. Industrial Park declared in Chilanga  
   <br>  
   **Why this matters:** The Wonderful Group’s Industrial Park expects $2.45 billion in investments and job creation. Focusing on phosphate-based fertiliser and thermal power, it aims to reduce imports and integrate Zambia into regional value chains.

7. Chikanta annuls 7 teen marriages  
   <br>  
   **Why this matters:** Chief Chikanta’s dissolution of underage unions advances child marriage eradication in Kalomo district. The initiative prioritizes reintegrating affected girls into education, aligning with national re-entry policies.

8. BoZ holds policy rate at 14.5%  
   <br>  
   **Why this matters:** The central bank maintains caution as inflation, though down to 13% in July, remains above the 6-8% target band. This balances growth support against global uncertainties, with inflation projected to return to target by early 2026.
