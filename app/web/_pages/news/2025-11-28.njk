Today's developments reflect our nation's economic resilience amidst ongoing challenges, with notable progress in inflation control and energy sector investments, while political and social discourse continues to shape national dialogue ahead of 2026 elections.

## Main Stories
1.  **Inflation Drops to 10.9%, Trade Surplus Improves**  
    Zambia's annual inflation rate decreased to 10.9% in November 2025 from 11.9% in October, driven by lower non-food prices, easing the cost-of-living pressure on households. Concurrently, our trade surplus significantly increased to K1.1 billion in October, up K700 million from September, strengthening our economic position.
2.  **$100 Million Presidential Energy Initiative Launched**  
    The Presidential Constituency Energy Initiative (PCEI) is commencing with an initial K2.3 billion (US$100 million) from CDF, ZCCM-IH, and commercial banks, aiming to address our critical power deficit. A special purpose vehicle involving key ministries will manage the total K4.6 billion project, crucial for stabilizing electricity supply for homes and businesses nationwide.
3.  **Yango Zambia Launches "Win A Car Bonanza" for Drivers**  
    Partner drivers across Zambia have the chance to win one of ten Honda Fit vehicles through Yango's new incentive program running until April 2026. Drivers earn tickets for weekly draws based on trip volume (one ticket per 100 weekly trips), offering tangible rewards for their vital role in our mobility sector and boosting driver entrepreneurship – a welcome boost in tough times.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Governance & Justice:**
    *   Lukashya MP George Chisanga calls for broader public consultation on the proposed law regulating state funerals before parliamentary consideration.
    *   Chishimba Kambwili missed his court appearance for unlawful assembly charges due to a reported medical emergency, later clarifying it was a minor accident.
* **Political Discourse:**
    *   Given Lubinda advised President Hichilema against antagonizing the Church, suggesting he will need its solace post-presidency, amid tensions over Bill 7.
    *   Archbishop Ignatius Chama criticized the government, stating "everything is turning into a crime" like "Animal Farm," following his support for protests against Bill 7.
    *   UPND Deputy Spokesperson Elvis Nkandu defended the government's references to past PF failures as necessary context for current progress and future goals.
* **Energy Policy:**
    *   Energy Minister Makozo Chikote demanded concrete results, not promises, from utilities and investors tackling the power crisis, emphasizing the severe impact on citizens and the economy.
