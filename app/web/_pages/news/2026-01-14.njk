**As our nation navigates economic optimism with a stronger Kwacha and celebrates payments reaching our hardworking farmers, we also confront sobering workplace safety concerns and witness ongoing legal proceedings. These developments collectively shape our daily lives and national trajectory.**

## Main Stories
1.  **Mopani Mine Accident Claims Two Lives in Kitwe**  
    Two employees of Reliant Mines contractor, Josiah Silomba (42) and Justin Mutaba (50), both from Wusakile Township, died in an underground blasting accident at Mopani Copper Mines' South Ore Body Shaft on January 13th. Their bodies were recovered early on January 14th and are at Kitwe Teaching Hospital mortuary awaiting postmortem, highlighting critical safety imperatives within our vital mining sector.
2.  **Government Urges Businesses to Pass Kwacha Gains to Consumers'**  
    Minister Chipoka Mulenga calls on traders, retailers, manufacturers, and wholesalers to reduce prices reflecting the Kwacha's appreciation to its strongest level in over two years. This move, stemming from limiting foreign currency use in local transactions, aims to ease the cost of living, strengthen Zambians' purchasing power, and support sustainable growth by passing on reduced import and input costs.
3.  **FRA Completes K11 Billion Payments to 2025 Maize Suppliers**  
    The Food Reserve Agency confirms disbursing over K11 billion to all farmers who supplied maize during the 2025 marketing season, with funds accessible in banks. While farmers paid via direct bank transfers have received their money, those opting for over-the-counter or mobile money payments, particularly in remote areas, are still being processed, ensuring crucial income flows into rural communities supporting our food security.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Governance & Justice:**
    *   Raphael Nakacinda, already serving an 18-month sentence for defamation of the President imposed by Magistrate Irene Wishimanga in May 2024 and upheld by the High Court in October 2025, was granted K20,000 cash bail with two sureties by Magistrate Idah Phiri on January 14th. This bail relates to his appeal against a separate concurrent six-month sentence she imposed on December 17, 2025, for expressing hatred against the Tonga people.
* **Consumer Affairs:**
    *   Thelma Chimuka-Simachembele has sued Mika Meats Limited in the Lusaka High Court, seeking US$25,000 compensation plus K10,000 special damages. She alleges she found a green housefly embedded in beef sausage purchased from their Chelstone-Obama butchery on February 6, 2025, leading to severe illness, hospitalization at UTH, and confirmation of contamination by the National Food Laboratory.
* **Tech & Business:**
    *   Yango Zambia reports a significant surge in digital service adoption across daily commutes, airport travel, professional journeys, and nightlife in Zambia between December 2024 and December 2025. Country Head Kabanda Chewe stated the company continues investing to enhance safety, service quality, and its SuperApp vision, aiming to support Zambia's technological and economic development.
