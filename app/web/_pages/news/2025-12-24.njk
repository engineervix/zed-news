Today's developments centre on democratic processes as we prepare for a key local election, urgent road safety measures during peak travel, and the ongoing national conversation regarding the final resting place of a former leader.

## Main Stories
1. **Kasama Mayoral By-Election Set for January 29, 2026**
   The Electoral Commission of Zambia (ECZ) has scheduled the Kasama mayoral by-election for January 29, 2026, following the passing of Mayor Theresa Kolala (PF) on December 5, 2025. Nominations will occur on December 30, 2025, with campaign periods and specific nomination fees (K15,000 male, K13,500 female, K10,000 youth/PWD) and Grade 12 certificate requirements outlined, ensuring our local governance continues without interruption.

2. **RTSA Urges Extreme Caution on Roads During Festive Travel**
   The Road Transport and Safety Agency (RTSA) has issued a strong warning to all motorists to adhere strictly to traffic rules, avoid speeding, driving under influence, and phone use, and ensure valid licenses and seatbelt use as festive travel surges. Citing 123 accidents, 14 deaths, and 55 serious injuries during the 2024 festive season, RTSA, collaborating with law enforcement, will intensify highway patrols to protect Zambian families on the move.

3. **Lungu Family Granted Leave to Appeal Burial Order**
   The Supreme Court of Appeal in South Africa has granted the family of late former President Edgar Lungu permission to appeal the order requiring his body's repatriation to Zambia for a state funeral. This follows the High Court's earlier ruling, contested by the family who argue their rights weren't considered, prolonging the resolution since his passing in South Africa on June 5, 2025.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Governance & Justice:**
    *   The Lungu family faces potential cost liabilities if they fail to proceed with their appeal against the burial repatriation order.

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
* Close monitoring of the Kasama by-election process, including candidate nominations on December 30th and the subsequent campaign period.
* Heightened RTSA and police road safety enforcement operations nationwide throughout the festive season.
* The progression of the Lungu family's appeal in the South African courts regarding the former President's burial.
