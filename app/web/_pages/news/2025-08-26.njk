Government announces structured gold mining plans for Mfuwe amid significant mineral discoveries, while SADC nations collaborate to combat Peste des Petits Ruminants threatening regional livestock. Developments continue regarding the repatriation and burial arrangements for late former President Edgar Lungu following a South African court ruling.

## Main Stories
1.  **Structured Gold Mining in Mfuwe Planned**

    Southern African Development Community countries are establishing a buffer zone against Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR), described by Minister Peter Kapala as a major threat to livelihoods and food security.

3.  **Government Commits to Dignified Burial for Lungu**
    Secretary to Cabinet Patrick Kangwa confirmed the government respects the South African Constitutional Court's dismissal of the Lungu family's appeal but remains committed to working with the family on burial arrangements.
