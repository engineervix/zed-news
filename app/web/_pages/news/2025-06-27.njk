Zambia’s current landscape is characterized by cautious optimism in economic growth, ongoing political stability, and a focus on technological and social reforms. The government’s proactive steps towards regulating emerging technologies like AI, efforts to foster inclusive sports and community development, and the deferment of contentious constitutional amendments highlight a nation navigating development with citizen engagement at the forefront. Meanwhile, regional and international collaborations continue to shape Zambia’s strategic position, especially in agriculture, refugee support, and infrastructure.

## Main Stories

1. AI Regulation Movement Signals Zambia’s Tech Forward Vision
The Zambian National Assembly has adopted a motion to develop a policy framework for regulating Artificial Intelligence (AI). This decisive step indicates Zambia’s recognition of AI’s transformative potential and the need to establish legal boundaries to mitigate risks while encouraging innovation. By embracing responsible governance of emerging technologies, Zambia positions itself as a proactive player in the tech landscape, balancing progress with societal safeguards.

2. Zambia’s Economy Grows by 4.5% in First Quarter of 2025
Economic indicators reveal a promising recovery, with Zambia’s GDP expanding by 4.5%, driven mainly by agriculture, forestry, and fishing sectors. This positive trend suggests resilience and potential for sustained growth, which could attract further investment and improve living standards. It underscores the country’s emerging status as an African economic recovery story amidst global uncertainties.

3. Political Tensions Rise Over Post-Burial Crackdowns on PF Supporters
Fears of impending arrests within the Patriotic Front (PF) deepen after supporters mourned former President Edgar Lungu’s delayed funeral. Patriotic Front officials anticipate a government crackdown following the burial, reflecting heightened political tensions and fears of suppression. This situation underscores the fragile nature of Zambia’s political climate and the importance of safeguarding democratic processes.

4. Government’s Efforts to Reconcile with Lungu’s Family and Regional Diplomacy
The Zambian government, led by Minister Mulambo Haimbe, is actively seeking to engage with the family of the late President Lungu to arrange a dignified farewell, with regional support from South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa. This move aims to foster reconciliation and regional stability, emphasizing Zambia’s diplomatic approach to political and national healing.

5. Constitutional Bill 7 Delayed to Enhance Public Consultation
In a move demonstrating democratic responsiveness, Zambia’s Parliament has deferred deliberations on the controversial Bill 7 following President Hichilema’s call for broader public consultations. This delay highlights the government’s commitment to inclusive governance, potentially leading to more transparent and participatory constitutional reforms that reflect citizens’ aspirations.

6. Education and Social Development Under Threat and Opportunity
High resignation rates among academic staff at Copperbelt University raise concerns over educational quality, linked to salary disparities. Meanwhile, community-driven initiatives, such as the Ministers’ spouses fundraising K1.4 million for social welfare, showcase efforts to address socio-economic challenges through civil society. These contrasting stories reflect both vulnerabilities and resilience within Zambia’s social fabric.

7. Media, Investment, and Civil Rights in Focus
Legal battles continue over investigative journalism, with the court ruling to proceed with a documentary on Chinese investments, underscoring the importance of press freedom. Simultaneously, the ongoing support for grassroots football and local elections, like UPND’s win in Fibalala Ward, demonstrate active civic engagement and the nation’s efforts to foster inclusive community participation.
