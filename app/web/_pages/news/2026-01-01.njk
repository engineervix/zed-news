Zambia's global standing and economic consolidation took centre stage as President Hichilema's international recognition underscored our nation's reform progress, while fiscal discipline and debt restructuring milestones bolstered domestic stability; concurrently, a high-profile investigation reaffirmed institutional accountability.

## Main Stories
1.  President Hichilema Honoured Among World Leaders by The Telegraph
    This significant recognition by The Telegraph's editors, based on four years of sustained reforms and international engagement, positions Zambia as a notable economic reform case study and highlights our strategic geopolitical relevance due to vast copper reserves critical for the global green transition.
2.  Zambia Achieves Key Economic Milestones in 2025
    Our nation marked a decisive economic turning point with the Kwacha stabilising at approximately K22.5 per US dollar, underpinned by stronger reserves and debt restructuring, alongside an exit from sovereign default status through credit rating upgrades to CCC+ and B-, reopening vital access to global capital markets.
3.  DEC Summons Archbishop Banda Over Vehicle Investigation
    The Drug Enforcement Commission has confirmed summoning Lusaka Archbishop Alick Banda to appear next Monday concerning investigations into a Hilux vehicle he received, linked to the improper disposal of government vehicles by ZRA, which has already seen former commissioner Kingsley Chanda jailed.

## Other Notable Stories
* **Governance & Justice:** The DEC Director General, Nason Banda, stressed that summoning Archbishop Alick Banda is procedural and not political, confirming the vehicle in question is part of an ongoing investigation where convictions have already been secured.

## Key Takeaways & Watchpoints
* Maintain the momentum of economic reforms and fiscal discipline to solidify the gains of 2025 and further improve Zambia's creditworthiness and market confidence.
* Observe the progression of the DEC investigation involving Archbishop Banda, reinforcing the principle that accountability applies to all citizens equally.
