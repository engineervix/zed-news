description: "In the Zed News Podcast episode 234, Ayanda discusses various news items including Reverend Bishop Festus Chulu's emphasis on unity in diversity and the need to combat tribalism in politics, President Hakainde Hichilema's claims about not giving out 'sacks of money' to chiefs, and Levy Ngoma's statement that criminals often claim political victimization when the law catches up with them. The episode also touches on Thabo Kawana's denial of seeking to replace Chief Government Spokesperson Cornelius Mweetwa, Ronald Chitotela's defense of Chiyeso and his own financial dealings, Wynter Kabimba's warning to President Hakainde Hichilema, and Minister Gary Nkombo's emphasis on individual responsibility for children. Dr. Chitalu Chilufya expresses his intentions to contest for the presidency during the general conference of the PF party, and former President Edgar Lungu encourages the church to be fearless in speaking for citizens. The Southern Africa Network Against Corruption urges President Hakainde Hichilema to establish a commission of inquiry into mukula trade, and Java Foods launches a 120-gram pack of eeZee YoPaka noodles in response to growing demand."
