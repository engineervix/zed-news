description: "In this episode of Zed News Podcast, Ayanda discusses the recent Absa Cup final and the positive impact of President Hakainde Hichilema's attendance. Grace Chanda scores her first goal for Madrid CFF since her return from illness, while RED Arrows and Kabwe Warriors prepare for their league fixture. The Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) and its aggrieved parties agree to settle their dispute out of court, and the U17 women's national team is encouraged to continue working hard for a spot in the FIFA U17 Women's World Cup. Amos Chanda appeals against his one-year jail term, and former tourism minister Ronald Chitotela seeks to appeal a judgment ordering him to pay a debt."
