description: "In today's episode, Ayanda discusses various news items, including TPAZ's suggestion to focus on planning the best ways to trade mukula, the final U17 squad selection for the FIFA Women's World Cup qualifiers, and concerns over third-party involvement in football activities that could lead to a FIFA ban. The episode also covers the recognition of casual and domestic workers on Labour Day, MAESTRO United's call for FAZ to be accountable for government funds, and criticism of the government for giving away Mopani and KCM to foreign investors. Additionally, the episode touches on the distribution of relief food in drought-affected areas, Standard Petroleum's commitment to deliver cheap fuel, and the PF faction's dismissal of the Auditor General's Report on Zambia's external debt stock."
