description: "The Zambian government has emphasized that the delimitation process is being carried out by the Electoral Commission of Zambia and not for political gain. Meanwhile, various news stories highlight the importance of education, with the launch of the \"End Learning Poverty for All in Africa\" campaign, and the need to address skills gaps in the aviation sector. Additionally, the government is facing criticism over the imposition of tariffs, which could lead to a trade war, and is being urged to prioritize constitutional reforms and address issues such as sexual violence and gender-based violence."
