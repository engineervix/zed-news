In politics, the Zambia We Want party appoints a new spokesperson and former President Edgar Lungu criticizes the current government. In other news, the Health Minister discusses the potential of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare, while the economy faces challenges due to the DRC's importation ban. Legal news highlights the Judiciary's decision to broadcast court proceedings and Socialist Party leader Fred M'membe's arrest. In sports, President Hakainde Hichilema encourages reflection on Zambia's sports culture, and in business, the Citizens Economic Empowerment Commission reports a high loan recovery rate. The podcast ends with economic predictions and the deactivation of scammer SIM cards."
