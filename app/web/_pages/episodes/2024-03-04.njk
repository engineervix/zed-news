description: In this episode, President Hakainde Hichilema discusses the government's plan to address food security through boreholes and irrigation, declaring the ongoing drought a national disaster. The distribution of Tutwa Ngulube's estate is delayed due to claims of multiple children born out of wedlock. Mutale Mwanza defends herself in an assault lawsuit, accusing the plaintiff of misinterpreting a secured gun as a threat. Hichilema criticizes government officials for traveling on business class, urging them to be prudent with resources during the national disaster. Lastly, Donald Trump supporters are accused of using AI-generated fake images to target black voters and promote a false narrative of Mr. Trump's popularity in the black community.
