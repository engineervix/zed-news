description: "In this episode of the Zed News Podcast, President Hakainde Hichilema's visit to Beijing strengthens Zambia-China relations, with a call for increased investment in Africa's critical minerals sector. Domestically, the government has issued an evacuation notice to small-scale miners following a tragic mine accident and awarded compensation to those aiding in body retrieval. In other news, a self-proclaimed pastor and two others have appeared in court for allegedly possessing fake US$100 bills. On the economic front, ZCCM-Investment Holding will contribute $35 million towards a power plant construction, and ZESCO has signed an agreement with China Datang Corporation for solar energy projects. Additionally, the episode covers a generous food donation from Burundi, the suspension of medical licensure examinations, and revisions to Airtel Money tariffs. In sports news, Red Arrows have climbed to fifth place in the MTN Super League, and Copper Queens captain Barbra Banda has been nominated for the Ballon d'Or award."
