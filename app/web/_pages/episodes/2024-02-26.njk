description: Zambia's Rachael Kundananji warns Ghana to not be underestimated in the second leg of the Olympic Qualifier, as the Copper Queens aim to build on their 1-0 win over Ghana in the first leg. The State has opposed jailed former Deputy Inspector General of Police Charity Katanga's bail application pending appeal, arguing that she has not demonstrated any exceptional circumstances to warrant the court to grant her request.
