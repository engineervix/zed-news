description: "The Zambian government is facing criticism over its cyber laws, with some arguing that revising them could promote hate speech and falsehoods. Meanwhile, the country\u0027s macroeconomic environment is showing signs of recovery and stability, according to the Finance Minister. Additionally, civil society organizations are calling for the establishment of an electoral court ahead of the 2026 general elections to strengthen the administration of justice in electoral disputes."
