description: "The UN has expressed concern over unsustainable debt levels in Least Developed Countries. In local news, power deficit is expected to be over soon, and Energy Minister Makozo Chikote has promised to become the \"minister of light\". The Zambia Medicines and Medical Supplies Agency has been described as a failed project by Secretary to Treasury Felix Nkulukusa. President Hakainde Hichilema has fired Minister of Local Government and Rural Development Gary Nkombo, and replaced him with a new minister. The Attorney General has emphasized the need for well-drafted laws to avoid ambiguity. A former press aide to ex-president Edgar Lungu, Amos Chanda, has defended his new role as a media consultant for the United Party for National Development. A murder has been reported in Eastern Province, where a woman was killed by her brother after she tried to stop him from beating their mother. The Bank of Zambia has launched new bank notes and coins, and the Higher Education Loans and Scholarships Board has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Basic Education Teachers Union of Zambia to offer teachers a 100% bursary. The Football Association of Zambia is working to resolve the drama surrounding its elective Annual General Meeting."
