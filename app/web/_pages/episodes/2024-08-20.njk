description: "The Zed News Podcast covers various topics, including sports, politics, illegal mining, and energy. In sports, FAZ president Andrew Kamanga remains optimistic about Zambia's performance in CAF interclub competitions despite recent losses. In politics, the Makebi Zulu law firm withdrew its services to former Lusaka Province Minister Bowman Lusambo and his wife Nancy, who face charges of possession of property suspected to be proceeds of crime, conspiracy to defraud, and tax evasion. In other news, President Hakainde Hichilema calls for focusing on productive matters instead of social media gossip, while Chief Justice Mumba Malila praises the late former First Lady Maureen Mwanawasa. Mines Minister Paul Kabuswe stresses that the government will tackle illegal mining in Chingola, as President Hakainde Hichilema is set to hand over Konkola Copper Mines to Vedanta Resources Limited. Lastly, ZESCO spokesperson Matongo Maumbi states that the recent increase in load-shedding hours should be the last if power imports and local generation proceed as expected."
