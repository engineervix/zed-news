description: "**Episode 262, Friday, July 12th, 2024***Host: Ayanda*1. **Minister of Health Sylvia Masebo** announced that one patient has died from severe pneumonia caused by influenza and another bacterial infection at the University Teaching Hospital, while 13 others are admitted with similar conditions. The Minister urged the public to take precautionary measures seriously as the Ministry continues to monitor the trends of reported respiratory infections and Influenza-like illnesses.2. **Makebi Zulu, a Patriotic Front lawyer**, advocated for the Chief Justice Mumba Malila to allow live broadcasts of public interest court proceedings, enabling direct access to information. The news editor and content publisher supported Zulu's advocacy for live court coverage of high-profile cases, viewing it as a step towards greater transparency and accountability in the judicial system.3. **James**, an employee, realized that he couldn't maintain a minimum bank balance due to the large expenses of supporting seven families from his salary of K15,000.00, leading to constant messages from his bank reminding him of the minimum balance requirement.4. **Red Arrows** will face Nyasa Big Bullets of Malawi in the first preliminary round of the CAF Champions League, while ZESCO United has been drawn against Dynamos FC of Zimbabwe in the CAF Confederation Cup first preliminary round.5. **Kelvin Mambwe**, UNZALARU Secretary General, emphasized that despite some UNZA staff supporting the UPND, they should not remain silent when the government still owes them money. He finds it hard to believe the government lacks funds given the recent FIC report, and UNZA lecturers and support staff staged a peaceful protest demanding their dues be settled before students return on Monday.6. **Timothy Moono**, ACC Head of Corporate Communications**, confirmed that the Commission is actively working on cases reported by the FIC and collaborates with them without waiting for statements from State House. Constitutional Lawyer Dr. O'Brien Kaaba suggested that President Hakainde Hichilema should remove incompetent heads of institutions leading the fight against corruption.7. **"
