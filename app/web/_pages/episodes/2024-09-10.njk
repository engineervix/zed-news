description: "In this episode of the Zed News Podcast, Ayanda discusses the ECZ's indefinite suspension of eight GCE exam centers for malpractices, resulting in the nullification of results for over 4,700 candidates. ZEMA has approved four solar power projects, and rooftop solar units are gaining popularity due to Zambia's energy crisis. A power struggle in Lunte District, the government's rainwater harvesting efforts, and the Farmers Input Support Program are also discussed. Legal news includes admissions in court cases and a case involving a ZRA car auction. Trade Kings sponsorship and a ZRA Taxpayer Appreciation Day are announced. The passing of James Earl Jones and sports news, including the Chipolopolo AFCON qualifier and the CAF Champions League, are also covered."
