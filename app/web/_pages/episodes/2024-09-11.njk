description: "Zambia's ZIPAR urged Zesco to revise its tariff hike proposal considering stakeholder concerns, while tenants vacated Society Business Park due to safety concerns. In a corruption case, Bowman Lusambo defended his wealth as legally acquired, and there were calls for investigations into the utilization of US$3 billion Eurobonds. Meanwhile, the World Food Programme launched a platform to help small-scale farmers, and Zambia's football team broke a six-game losing streak."
