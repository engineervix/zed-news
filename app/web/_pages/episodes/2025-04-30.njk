description: "The Electoral Commission of Zambia has set June 26 for the Lumezi parliamentary by-elections, while Youth, Sports and Arts Minister Elvis Nkandu has criticized Socialist Party leader Fred M\u0027membe as arrogant and self-centered, warning Zambians against electing him as president. Meanwhile, the Patriotic Front has accused the UPND of entering government fraudulently, and an economist has expressed doubts about Zambia achieving the IMF\u0027s projected 6.2% GDP growth this year."
