description: "In today's episode, the Zambia women's relay team qualifies for the World Relay Athletics Championship in the Bahamas, while the Chipolopolo faces Malawi in the third-place play-off at the Four-Nations tournament. Xiomara Mapepa's illegal move to Galatasaray sparks a dispute between her and Elite Ladies Football Club, and the SADC Truck Drivers Association of Zambia believes upgrading the Nakonde One-Stop-Border-Post will decrease the prevalence of communicable diseases among drivers. Additionally, the Lusaka City Council and State Police have arrested 50 people for violent behavior against council officers during the enforcement of a street vending ban in the Central Business District."
