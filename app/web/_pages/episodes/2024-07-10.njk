description: "In today's episode of the Zed News Podcast, Ayanda discusses various news items from Zambia. The Lusaka City Council has suspended operations at Royal Park Platinum due to unsanitary conditions, and the Kopala One boxing tournament will take place in Kitwe this weekend. Four individuals were arrested for attempting to protest against loadshedding at ZESCO Headquarters, and the Inter Company Relay will host 1,200 participants under the theme "Mitigating Climate Change." Nchanga Rangers has signed two Cameroonian junior internationals, and the RED Arrows will face Gor Mahia in their first match of the CECAFA invitational tournament today in Tanzania. The episode also touches on chronic illnesses, politicians' tendency to lie, and the Constitutional Court's dismissal of preliminary issues in a petition challenging former President Edgar Lungu's eligibility to contest future elections."
