description: "In this episode of the Zed News Podcast, Ayanda discusses Fashion Sakala's impressive goal-scoring record for his Saudi club despite being left out of Zambia's provisional squad for World Cup qualifiers. The Kariba Dam's power generation capacity has significantly decreased, leading to extended load shedding. Fashion Sakala demands respect after being snubbed from the Chipolopolo squad, while Chaminuka Wildlife Estates has completed its first major solarization project for a sustainable lifestyle. Yango and Zamtel partner to provide data-free rides and discounted minutes for drivers, and Abner Shikapwasha, the late former Zambia Airforce commander's son, is turned into a state witness against his step-mother. The Inspector General of Police denies former President Lungu's allegations of police plans to ambush him, and Lungu calls for early elections amid the economic crisis."
