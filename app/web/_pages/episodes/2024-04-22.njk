description: "In this episode of the Zed News Podcast, Ayanda discusses various news items from Monday, April 22nd, 2024. Security firms, including Magnum Security and Arm Secure Security, are accused of deducting statutory obligations from employees' salaries without remitting them to the relevant authorities. Konkola Blades defeated MUZA FC 2-0, while Jean Kapata acknowledged that the Kingsland degazetting was done under the instruction of the Office of the President. Heritage Party leader Chishala Kateka believes no party can win the general elections without forming an alliance, and constitutional lawyer John Sangwa expressed his willingness to lead Zambia as president if the citizens believe he can make a difference. The Food Reserve Agency (FRA) received 6,080.73 metric tonnes of non-genetically modified grade A white maize from commercial farmers contracted under the Early Maize Programme, and the National Road Fund Agency (NRFA) received K2.6 billion from the Ministry of Finance and National Planning in the first quarter of 2024 for road projects across the country."
