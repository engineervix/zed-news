description: "Zambian government awaits FAZ's proposal for the men's national team's European camp, as the country prepares to host the sixth edition of the RASA awards. Tourist arrivals in Livingstone have doubled, and athletes like Muzala Samukonga are determined to succeed at the 2024 Olympic Games. Avram Grant announces a 27-member provisional squad for the FIFA World Cup qualifiers, and female soccer stars receive little recognition for their achievements. The State drops charges against Kelvin Fube and Beauty Chama, and a man is arrested for allegedly forging a fraudulent letter from the FNB Zambia CEO."
