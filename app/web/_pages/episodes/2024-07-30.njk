description: "In this episode of the Zed News Podcast, Ayanda covers a range of topics from Zambia's sports scene, including the Copper Queens' loss at the Paris Olympics and Margaret Tembo's historic Olympic boxing participation, to political updates on President Hakainde Hichilema's frustration with bureaucracy and a court ruling dismissing a defamation case against News Diggers. In addition, the podcast discusses a Lusaka High Court case involving Miles Sampa, the UPND National Chairman's response to Kelvin Fube Bwalya's comments, and the IMF's emphasis on developing progressive tax policies in Zambia. The episode also touches on the Drug Enforcement Commission's seizure of properties from former First Lady Esther Lungu and convicted PF cadre Francis Muchemwa. Lastly, the launch of Yango Navigator, a free service providing real-time traffic updates, is announced."
